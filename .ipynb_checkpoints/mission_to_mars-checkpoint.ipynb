Once the sample tube has been filled, the robotic arm returns the drill bit and tube to the carousel, where they wend their way to processing stations and storage.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The bit carousel was the last piece of the Mars 2020 rover's Sample Caching System to be installed,\\\" said JPL's John McNamee, project manager of Mars 2020. \\\"And while the rover interior is essentially complete — a battery and a camera used during landing are planned in coming weeks — the assembly and test team will not be resting on their laurels.

Two subsequent missions, currently in the concept stage, would be needed to bring the Mars 2020 samples home.</p>\\n\\n<p>One mission would land a rocket (the Mars Ascent Vehicle) and a spacecraft carrying a rover about the size of NASA's Opportunity Mars rover at Jezero Crater. The rover would gather the cached samples and carry them back to the ascent vehicle, which would then launch the samples into Mars orbit. The other mission (which would already be in orbit around Mars when the ascent vehicle launches) would rendezvous with and capture the orbiting samples, before returning them to Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"NASA and the European Space Agency are solidifying these exciting mission concepts to retrieve the samples,\\\" said Zurbuchen. \\\"Just as the first samples returned to Earth from the Moon's Sea of Tranquility made history, the first samples returned to Earth from another planet will make history and amaze us all over again.

But Curiosity has detected similarly high amounts of clay on other parts of Mount Sharp, including in areas where MRO didn't detect clay. That's led scientists to wonder what is causing the findings from orbit and the surface to differ. </p>\\n\\n<p>The science team is thinking through possible reasons as to why the clay minerals here stood out to MRO. The rover encountered a \\\"parking lot full of gravel and pebbles\\\" when it first entered the area, said the campaign's other co-lead, Valerie Fox of Caltech. One idea is that the pebbles are the key: Although the individual pebbles are too small for MRO to see, they may collectively appear to the orbiter as a single clay signal scattered across the area. Dust also settles more readily over flat rocks than it does over the pebbles; that same dust can obscure the signals seen from space. The pebbles were too small for Curiosity to drill into, so the science team is looking for other clues to solve this puzzle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity exited the pebble parking lot back in June and started to encounter more complex geologic features. It stopped to take a 360-degree panorama at an outcrop called \\\"Teal Ridge.\\\" More recently, it took detailed images of \\\"Strathdon,\\\" a rock made of dozens of sediment layers that have hardened into a brittle, wavy heap. Unlike the thin, flat layers associated with lake sediments Curiosity has studied, the wavy layers in these features suggest a more dynamic environment. Wind, flowing water or both could have shaped this area.</p>\\n\\n<p><span><div class=\"column-width image_module\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/internal_resources/details/original/707_Mastcam_Views_%22Strathdon%22.jpeg\">\\n<img alt='Mastcam Views \\\"Strathdon\\\"' src=\"/internal_resources/707\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n</figcaption></figure></div></span><b>Mastcam Views \\\"Strathdon\\\": </b><span>This mosaic of images shows a boulder-sized rock called \\\"Strathdon,\\\" which is made up of many complex layers.

Engineers installed the first batch of items delivered by MEDLI2 onto the heat shield of the entry vehicle this week. The aeroshell of the entry vehicle consists of a heat shield and backshell and will protect the Mars 2020 rover in transit from Earth to Mars and during the entry through the atmosphere of Mars on its way to the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Understanding the actual performance of our current generation of entry vehicles is crucial to safe, reliable landing of future robotic and crewed Mars missions. MEDLI2 pressure and thermal measurements are the key to that understanding,\\\" said Todd White, MEDLI2 principal investigator.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 recently completed environmental testing on flight hardware at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The testing, including vibration and thermal vacuum testing, demonstrates the ability of the hardware to survive the large vibratory loads experienced during the launch and the extreme cold during the cruise to Mars. High-temperature sterilization of some of the hardware has also been successfully concluded, allowing MEDLI2 to minimize the potential of transporting terrestrial biological material unintentionally to the surface of Mars. All of the MEDLI2 components are set to be completely installed on the Mars 2020 aeroshell by the end of November 2019.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 includes three types of sensors (thermocouples, heat flux sensors and pressure transducers), a data acquisition and signal conditioning unit (the Sensor Support Electronics Unit) to record the heating and atmospheric pressure experienced during entry and through parachute deployment, and the harnessing between the sensors and the Sensor Support Electronics unit. Building on the first <a href='\\\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/medli/index.html\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>MEDLI</a> suite, which flew on <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\\\"'>NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission</a>, instrumentation is again being applied to the heat shield, but in a different configuration to better measure the flow characteristics. This time instrumentation is being installed on the backshell as well to collect measurements of the heating and the surface pressure to aid in reducing the large uncertainty applied to the current predicted results.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 spacecraft will enter Mars' atmosphere traveling about 12,500 mph (20,120 kph). MEDLI2 will start to collect data about five hours prior to the entry and continue to collect data throughout the entry and part of the descent phases. It will take about 6 minutes to slow the spacecraft from 12,500 mph (20,120 kph) to just under 2 mph (3 kph). MEDLI2 will measure crucial entry and descent performance data on the Mars 2020 heat shield and backshell.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 flight data will fill critical space entry, descent and landing knowledge gaps which would advance current EDL technology. This technology also has the potential to reduce TPS mass by up to 35%, which would result in significant cost reductions. This technology and data will also help reduce the size of the landed footprint (the uncertainty footprint) allowing access to sites with high scientific interest that might otherwise be difficult to reach.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Uncertainties in our ability to model and predict the performance of an entry vehicle and the associated thermal protection system mean that large margins (100% to 200%) need to be included in our predictions to ensure the entry vehicle can survive the worst case conditions,\\\" said Henry Wright, MEDLI2 project manager. \\\"Flight data will allow the uncertainties in the models to be further reduced leading to a more accurate prediction of the loads and performance.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The key objectives of MEDLI2 are to reduce design margin and prediction uncertainties for the aerothermal environments and aerodynamic database. Close analysis of MEDLI2 flight data is vital to future NASA exploration of the Red Planet. MEDLI2 will explore areas not addressed during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission and seek answers to questions generated from examining MEDLI/MSL data.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 is a <a href='\\\"https://gameon.nasa.gov/\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Game Changing Development</a> project led by <a href='\\\"http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/home/index.html\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate</a> with support from the <a href='\\\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/index.html\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate</a> and the <a href='\\\"https://science.nasa.gov/\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Science Mission Directorate</a>.

The generators consist of two major elements: a heat source that contains plutonium-238 (Pu-238) and thermocouples that convert the plutonium's decay heat energy to electricity. The Department of Energy (DOE) provides radioisotope power systems to NASA for civil space applications and will insert the fuel into the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal Generator at the DOE's Idaho National Laboratory. The mission’s MMRTG will later be shipped directly from the Idaho facility to the launch site at Cape Canaveral, Florida, for integration into the rover. The process of loading the heat source into the MMRTG is timed to a mission's launch date. The Mars 2020 fueling process has been initiated thanks to the continued progress constructing the rover and the spacecraft that will get it there.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"We are advancing on all fronts — including completion of the cruise stage that will guide us to Mars and the <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/#Mars2020-Technology\\\"'>sky crane</a> descent landing system that will gently lower us to the surface,\\\" said Project Manager John McNamee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission in Pasadena, California. \\\"And the rover is not only looking more and more like a rover each day, it's acting like one.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>With the exception of incorporating the Adaptive Caching Assembly, with its seven motors and more than 3,000 parts, work on the Mars 2020 rover's interior is 100% complete.

Among other challenges, subzero temperatures mean water can persist on the surface only as ice, and the planet's atmosphere offers little protection to plants (or people) from the Sun's radiation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, NASA has plans to eventually put humans on Mars, using lessons it will learn from its <a href='\\\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/moon2mars/\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Artemis lunar explorations</a>. And those humans will need to eat. Being able to produce food on Mars would help reduce the quantity of supplies consuming valuable space and fuel on crewed missions to the Red Planet. But figuring out how — and where — to produce that food, while also being exceedingly careful not to contaminate Mars with Earth-borne bacteria, are some of the challenges scientists and engineers face.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a new paper in Nature Astronomy, researchers propose that a material called aerogel might help humans one day build greenhouses and other habitats at Mars' mid-latitudes, where near-surface water ice has been identified. The study was funded by Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>\\n\\n<p>Aerogel is a Styrofoam-like solid that is 99% air, making it extremely light. It’s adept at preventing the transfer of heat as well, making it an excellent insulator; in fact, it's been used for that purpose on all of NASA's Mars rovers. Moreover, aerogel is translucent, allowing visible light to pass through while blocking ultraviolet light's harmful radiation. Most aerogel is made from silica, the same material found in glass.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"column-width image_module\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22657_PIA23342-16.jpg\">\\n<img alt=\"Scientists tested these samples of aerogel to see how they could be used as building materials on Mars.\" src=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22657_PIA23342-16.jpg\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nAerogel Samples: Scientists tested these samples of aerogel to see how they could be used as building materials on Mars. Credit: Robin Wordsworth/Harvard. <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22657/\\\"'>Full image and caption ›</a>\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>In an experiment conducted by lead author Robin Wordsworth of Harvard, 2-3 centimeters of silica aerogel allowed light from a lamp tuned to simulate Martian sunlight to heat the surface beneath it by up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius) — enough to raise temperatures on the Martian surface and melt water ice.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The study was meant as an initial test of aerogel's potential as a Martian building material,\\\" said second author Laura Kerber, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p>\\n\\n<p>Kerber participated in a 2015 NASA workshop to identify the best places on Mars to send astronauts. \\\"The ideal place for a Martian outpost would have plentiful water and moderate temperatures,\\\" she said. \\\"Mars is warmer around the equator, but most of the water ice is located at higher latitudes. Building with silica aerogel would allow us to artificially create warm environments where there is already water ice available.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Broadening the regions on Mars where humans could grow things also opens up new areas where they could conduct valuable scientific research, Kerber added.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>'Dark Spots' on Mars</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The aerogel experiment was inspired by the heating process that creates so-called dark spots that dot Mars' carbon dioxide ice caps during the spring. This kind of ice is better known on Earth as dry ice. Like aerogel, carbon dioxide ice is translucent, allowing sunlight to heat the surface below. As the soil warms, carbon dioxide gas accumulates between the ice and the warm surface, eventually causing the ice to rupture. That, in turn, creates a puff of gas that tosses soil beneath the ice onto its surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>The experiment explored a similar process with aerogel. The paper details how both a solid piece of aerogel as well as chunks of crushed aerogel can be used to heat the surface below. The researchers used varying levels of illumination produced by Martian seasons. The results suggest aerogel could even provide a heating effect in the bitter Martian winter. In the mid-latitudes, winter nighttime temperatures can be as cold as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius).</p>\\n\\n<p>The next step, Wordsworth said, is taking the experiment out of the lab and into Martian analogues like Chile's Atacama Desert or Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys. Like Mars, these environments reach subzero temperatures and are exceptionally dry.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Our prediction is that aerogel shielding should provide more efficient heating as it scales in size,\\\" Wordsworth said. \\\"That would be important to see under field conditions.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Challenges to Be Overcome</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While the experiment was an encouraging proof of concept, Wordsworth acknowledged there are still significant engineering challenges to overcome. Based on a climate model produced along with the experiment, it would take lots of aerogel and at least two Mars years (or four Earth years) of warming to produce a permanent region of liquid water underneath. Although aerogel is several times lighter than air, building structures with roofs made out of the material would require shipping large quantities of it to Mars or somehow manufacturing it there.</p>\\n\\n<p>Silica aerogel is very fragile and porous; layering it within another translucent material, or combining it with flexible materials, could prevent fracturing. Doing so could increase air pressure under a structure made with an aerogel roof or shield as well, allowing liquid water to pool more easily on the surface instead of vaporizing in the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p>But the study's authors noted that developing small habitability zones on Mars is more plausible than attempting to \\\"terraform\\\" the planet, as science-fiction writers have proposed doing in the past.

It will touch down on Feb. 18, 2021, in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) expanse full of steep cliffs, boulder fields and other things that could boobytrap the landing. A new technology called Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) will allow the spacecraft to avoid hazards autonomously.

They had hoped to send the lunar module Eagle toward a relatively flat landing zone with few craters, rocks and boulders. Instead, peering through his small, triangular commander's window, Armstrong saw a boulder field — very unfriendly for a lunar module. So the Apollo 11 commander took control of the descent from the onboard computer, piloting Eagle well beyond the boulder field, to a landing site that will forever be known as Tranquility Base.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"There had been Moon landings with robotic spacecraft before Apollo 11,\\\" said Al Chen, entry, descent and landing lead for NASA's Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \\\"But never before had a spacecraft on a descent toward its surface changed its trajectory to maneuver out of harm's way.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Chen and his Mars 2020 colleagues have experience landing spacecraft on the Red Planet without the help of a steely-eyed astronaut at the stick. But Mars 2020 is headed toward NASA's biggest Martian challenge yet. <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8387/nasa-announces-landing-site-for-mars-2020-rover/\\\"'>Jezero Crater</a> is a 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) indentation full of steep cliffsides, sand dunes, boulders fields and small impact craters. The team knew that to attempt a landing at Jezero — and with a rover carrying 50% more payload than the Curiosity rover, which landed at a more benign location near Mount Sharp — they would have to up their game.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"What we needed was a Neil Armstrong for Mars,\\\" said Chen. \\\"What we came up with was Terrain-Relative Navigation.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Carried aboard Mars 2020, Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN) is an autopilot that during landing can quickly figure out the spacecraft's location over — and more importantly, calculate its future location on — the Martian surface. Onboard, the rover's computer stores a map of hazards within Jezero Crater, and if the computed landing point is deemed too dangerous, TRN will command Mars 2020's descent stage to fly the rover to the safest reachable landing point.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>A Two-Part System</b></p>\\n\\n<p>To land an Apollo lunar module on the Moon required a crew of two (Armstrong had Buzz Aldrin feeding him information on their trajectory). Likewise, Terrain-Relative Navigation is actually two systems working together: the Lander Vision System and the Safe Target Selection system.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The first half of Terrain-Relative Navigation is the Lander Vision System [LVS], which determines where the spacecraft is over the Martian surface,\\\" said Andrew Johnson, guidance navigation and control subsystem manager for Mars 2020. \\\"If you say it quick — LVS — you'll understand why the team's unofficial mascot is Elvis Presley.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>LVS's operational lifetime is all of 25 seconds. It comes alive at about 13,000 feet (3,960 meters), commanding a camera on the rover to quickly take picture after picture of the Martian surface while still descending on a parachute. LVS scrutinizes one image a second, breaking each into squares that cover about 5,000 feet (1,520 meters) of surface area.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, unlike Neil Armstrong, LVS's real-time analysis isn't looking for specific crater rims or mountain peaks. Instead, inside each of those boxes, or landmarks, the system looks for unique patterns in contrasting light and dark created by surface features like cliffs, craters, boulder fields and mountains. It then compares any uncommon pattern with a map in its memory. When it finds five landmark matches during Coarse Landmark Matching mode, it takes another image and repeats the process.</p>\\n\\n<p>After three successful image-to-map comparisons, LVS kicks into a mode called Fine Landmark Matching. That's when the system breaks the surface into boxes 410 feet (125 meters) across, scanning for unique patterns and comparing them with the map. LVS is looking for at least 20 matches in that one second of eyeballing an image but usually makes much more — up to 150 — in order to generate an even more accurate plot of Mars 2020's trajectory.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Each time a suitable number of matches is made in an image, in either Course or Fine Landmark Matching, LVS updates where the spacecraft is at that moment,\\\" said Johnson. \\\"That update is then fed into the Safe Target Selection system.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This second part of the Terrain-Relative Navigation system uses LVS's position solution, calculates where it will land and then compares it to another onboard map, this one depicting areas within the landing zone understood to be either good for landing … or the kind with craters, cliffsides, boulders or rocks fields. If the plotted location isn't suitable, Safe Target Selection can change the rover's destiny, moving its landing point by up to 2,000 feet (600 meters).</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Put to the Test</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While Safe Target Selection operations can be investigated in a computer testbed within the confines of JPL, to gather optical data, the team needed to go farther afield: the Mojave Desert and Death Valley.</p>\\n\\n<p>Over three weeks in April and May of 2019, LVS flew 17 flights attached to the front of a helicopter, taking and processing image after image over the Mars-like terrain of Kelso Dunes, Hole-in-the-Wall, Lava Tube, Badwater, Panamint Valley and Mesquite Flat Dunes.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"We flew flight after flight, imitating the descent profile of the spacecraft,\\\" said Johnson. \\\"In each flight we performed multiple runs. Each run essentially imitated a Mars landing.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>All in all, the equivalent of 659 Mars landings took place during the test flights.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The data is in — TRN works,\\\" said Chen. \\\"Which is a good thing because Jezero is where our scientists want to be. And without TRN, the odds of successful landing at a good location for the rover are approximately 85%. With TRN, we feel confident we are up around 99%.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>But Chen is also quick to note that Mars is hard: Only about 40% of all missions sent to Mars — by any space agency — have successfully landed.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"To go farther we have to look to the past, and in that respect who better than the first?\\\" said Chen. \\\"In an interview some 35 years after Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong said, 'I think we tried very hard not to be overconfident. Because when you get overconfident, that's when something snaps up and bites you.'\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Mindful of that, the Mars 2020 TRN team's work will conclude only on Feb. 18, 2021, a little after 12 p.m. PST (3 p.m. EST), when their rover alights on Jezero Crater. But it is also just a beginning: Terrain-Relative Navigation's autonomous precision guidance could prove essential to landing humans safely on both the Moon and Mars. TRN could also be useful for landing equipment in multiple drops ahead of a human crew on either world — or others to be explored down the road.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover for the NASA Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to send your name to Mars with NASA's 2020 mission, you can do so until Sept. 30, 2019.

Based on DLR testing, the soil may not provide the kind of friction the mole was designed for. Without friction to balance the recoil from the self-hammering motion, the mole would simply bounce in place rather than dig.</p>\\n\\n<p>One sign of this unexpected soil type is apparent in images taken by a camera on the robotic arm: A small pit has formed around the mole as it's been hammering in place.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The images coming back from Mars confirm what we've seen in our testing here on Earth,\\\" said HP<sup>3</sup> Project Scientist Mattias Grott of DLR. \\\"Our calculations were correct: This cohesive soil is compacting into walls as the mole hammers.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The team wants to press on the soil near this pit using a small scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The hope is that this might collapse the pit and provide the necessary friction for the mole to dig.</p>\\n\\n<p>It's also still possible that the mole has hit a rock.

One ppbv means that if you take a volume of air on Mars, one billionth of the volume of air is methane.</p>\\n\\n<p>The finding came from the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) tunable laser spectrometer. It's exciting because microbial life is an important source of methane on Earth, but methane can also be created through interactions between <a href='\\\"https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/methane-stinks-earth-mars-and-beyond\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>rocks and water</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity doesn't have instruments that can definitively say what the source of the methane is, or even if it's coming from a local source within Gale Crater or elsewhere on the planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,\\\" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Curiosity team has <a href='\\\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/16dec_methanespike\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>detected methane</a> many times over the course of the mission. Previous papers have documented how background levels of the gas seem to <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8347/nasa-finds-ancient-organic-material-mysterious-methane-on-mars/\\\"'>rise and fall seasonally</a>. They've also noted sudden spikes of methane, but the science team knows very little about how long these transient plumes last or why they're different from the seasonal patterns.</p>\\n\\n<p>The SAM team organized a different experiment for this weekend to gather more information on what might be a transient plume. Whatever they find — even if it's an absence of methane — will add context to the recent measurement.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity's scientists need time to analyze these clues and conduct many more methane observations. They also need time to collaborate with other science teams, including those with the European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been in its science orbit for a little over a year without detecting any methane. Combining observations from the surface and from orbit could help scientists locate sources of the gas on the planet and understand how long it lasts in the Martian atmosphere. That might explain why the Trace Gas Orbiter's and Curiosity's methane observations have been so different.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information about Curiosity, visit:<br/>\\n<a href='\\\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'><b>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html</b></a><br/>\\n<a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\\\"'><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br/>\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br/>\\n818-393-2433<br/>\\n<a href='\\\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\\\"'>andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br/>\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br/>\\n202-358-1501<br/>\\n<a href='\\\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\\\"'>alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\",\"thumb\":\"/system/news_items/list_view_images/8452_methane_main-th.jpg\",\"main_image\":\"/system/news_items/main_images/8452_methane_main.jpeg\",\"status\":1},{\"id\":8451,\"title\":\"Mars 2020 Rover Gets Its Wheels\",\"target\":\"_self\",\"main_image_alt\":\"Mars 2020 Gets Its Wheels\",\"meta_author\":\"\",\"byline\":\"\",\"meta_keywords\":\"\",\"item_name\":\"\",\"updated_at\":\"2019-06-20T18:55:53.530Z\",\"url\":\"/news/8451/mars-2020-rover-gets-its-wheels/\",\"missions\":[[180,\"mars2020\",\"Mars 2020 Rover\"],[175,\"mep\",\"Mars Exploration Program\"]],\"news_type\":[[165,\"feature\",\"Feature Stories\"]],\"description\":\"With the mobility suspension in place, the rover not only looks more like a rover but has many of its 'big-ticket items' installed.\",\"date\":\"June 20, 2019\",\"body\":\"<p>In this image, taken on June 13, 2019, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, install the starboard legs and wheels — otherwise known as the mobility suspension — on the Mars 2020 rover.

There's no water on the surface to drink, either. The landscape is freezing, with no protection from the Sun's radiation or from passing dust storms. The keys to survival will be technology, research and testing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars 2020 will help on all those fronts. When it launches in July of 2020, the spacecraft will carry the latest scientific and engineering tools, which are coming together as <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/\\\"'>the rover is built</a> at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Here's a closer look.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Touchdown</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Every landing on Mars offers a learning opportunity. With Mars 2020, that includes how the spacecraft's heat shield and <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8380/third-aspire-test-confirms-mars-2020-parachute-a-go/\\\"'>parachute</a> perform in the planet's atmosphere, and how well its radar can sense the approaching surface. Sensors in the spacecraft's aeroshell (the capsule that encloses the rover) will study how it heats up and performs during atmospheric entry. These <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/#MEDLI2\\\"'>Mars Entry, Descent and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2)</a> sensors could help engineers improve their landing designs for big payloads like astronaut equipment and habitats.</p>\\n\\n<p>Landing a rover like this one also gives NASA more experience putting a heavy spacecraft on the surface of Mars; the challenge of landing in the thin Martian atmosphere scales with mass. The first crewed spacecraft will be titanic by comparison, carrying with it life support systems, supplies and shielding.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, Mars 2020 has a guidance system that will take a step toward safer landings. Called <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/\\\"'>Terrain Relative Navigation</a>, this new system figures out where the spacecraft is headed by taking camera images during descent and matching landmarks in them to a preloaded map. If the spacecraft drifts toward dangerous terrain, it will divert to a safer landing target.</p>\\n\\n<p>Terrain Relative Navigation allowed the 2020 team to select a landing site, <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8387/nasa-announces-landing-site-for-mars-2020-rover/\\\"'>Jezero Crater</a>, that was considered too risky for previous missions. This kind of autonomous guidance could prove essential to landing humans safely. It would also be useful for landing equipment in multiple drops ahead of a human crew.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Oxygen</b></p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\"image_module right\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/internal_resources/details/original/525_MOXIE.jpeg\">\\n<img alt=\"Members of NASA’s Mars 2020 project install the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) into the chassis of NASA’s next Mars rover.\" src=\"/internal_resources/525\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>This Is One Mars Rover With MOXIE</b>: Members of NASA’s Mars 2020 project install the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) into the chassis of NASA’s next Mars rover.

Although MOXIE is a small-scale demonstration, the hope is that its technology could evolve into bigger and more efficient oxygen generators in the future. Those would allow astronauts to create their own breathable air and would provide oxygen to burn rocket fuel needed to return humans to the Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>More importantly, MOXIE's descendants would save precious space on the first crewed vehicle to Mars. Not only would that leave more room for supplies, it could also reduce the cost and difficulty of getting from Earth to Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Water</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Satellites orbiting the Red Planet regularly peek underground using radar, but Mars 2020 is carrying a ground-penetrating radar called the <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/rimfax/\\\"'>Radar Imager for Mars' Subsurface Experiment (RIMFAX)</a> that will be the first operated at the Martian surface.

Dust blows everywhere, sticking to spacecraft and covering solar panels. And because the planet doesn't have a magnetic field, as Earth does, the Sun's radiation bathes the Martian surface. The orbits of Earth and Mars align best for interplanetary travel every two years, meaning the first astronauts on the Red Planet are likely to endure long exposures to radiation.\\n\\n<p>To help engineers design spacesuits to shield astronauts from the elements, NASA is sending five samples of spacesuit material along with one of Mars 2020's science instruments, called <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/sherloc/\\\"'>Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman &amp; Luminescence for Organics &amp; Chemicals (SHERLOC)</a>.

One device, called the <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/sherloc/\\\"'>Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman &amp; Luminescence for Organics &amp; Chemicals</a> (SHERLOC) instrument, will be used to detect chemicals on the Martian surface that are linked to the existence of life. To keep the instrument working well, a team from the <a href='\\\"https://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science</a> (ARES) division at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) recently built a new calibration device for the rover to check SHERLOC’s function and properly tune it during the upcoming mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>“SHERLOC is pretty complicated, and we came up with a list of 11 things that all have to be calibrated on this instrument,” said Marc Fries, ARES planetary scientist and Mars 2020 instrument co-investigator. “This sophisticated calibration device is also going to be used for a lot of other scientific and engineering investigations, and we’re really excited that it’s JSC’s contribution to the Mars 2020 rover.”</p>\\n\\n<p><b>On Target</b></p>\\n\\n<p>SHERLOC is mounted on the end of the rover's seven-foot robotic arm and includes a laser, camera and chemical analyzers, called spectrometers. The sensitive components will be used together to search for substances that have been altered by water and possibly reveal evidence of past microscopic life on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>“The rover’s scientific instruments go through all sorts of harsh conditions from the time they leave the lab until they arrive on the surface of Mars. SHERLOC needed a way to make sure it still operates as expected once it’s on the surface and throughout the duration of the mission,” said Trevor Graff, a scientist from Jacobs who works for ARES.</p>\\n\\n<p>The solution was to create the calibration target, or “cal target” for short. The device is approximately the size of a large cell phone and mounted on the front of the rover. On its face are 10 “targets,” which consist of samples of different materials. The idea is that researchers will occasionally check SHERLOC’s function by directing it to scan the different materials on the cal target. The researchers will already know what the readings on those materials should be when SHERLOC is working correctly. If the actual readings are off, they’ll make adjustments to SHERLOC to get it set properly, or know to compensate for the errors when they analyze the data later.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"column-width image_module\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22534_sherloc3-team-web.jpg\">\\n<img 2020=\"\" a=\"\" alt='\\\"Image' at=\"\" calibration=\"\" center.\\\"=\"\" clean=\"\" engineers=\"\" in=\"\" johnson=\"\" mars=\"\" nasa's=\"\" of=\"\" room=\"\" sherloc=\"\" space=\"\" src=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22534_sherloc3-team-web.jpg\" target=\"\" the=\"\" with=\"\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nThis is the first Mars flight hardware that has been designed, assembled &amp; tested at NASA-Johnson Space Center, led by Jacobs/JETS Chief Scientist Trevor Graff.

For example, a number of the targets hold spacesuit materials that could one day be used to protect astronauts exploring Mars. SHERLOC’s scans of those materials will not only help tune the instrument, but measure how the advanced fabrics and other suit materials will hold up in the Martian environment, too.</p>\\n\\n<p>“We also plan to build a small Mars exposure instrument here at JSC, and match the conditions inside it with weather data from the rover,” Fries said. “We’ll then place an identical set of spacesuit samples inside the chamber and periodically remove them to, for example, test the strength of fabrics or the clarity of helmet visor plastics. The result is we’ll be able to test spacesuit materials in Mars-like conditions long before astronauts ever go there.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Another target contains an actual sample of a meteorite ejected from Mars long ago and discovered on Earth in 1999.

Then the helicopter was moved to Lockheed Martin Space in Denver for compatibility testing with the Mars Helicopter Delivery System, which will hold the 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) spacecraft against the belly of the Mars 2020 rover during launch and interplanetary cruise before deploying it onto the surface of Mars after landing.</p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\"image_module right\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"https://prod-marscms.jpl.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/22365_PIA23151-16.jpg\">\\n<img alt=\"This image of the flight model of NASA’s Mars Helicopter was taken on Feb. 14, 2019, in a cleanroom at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \" src=\"https://prod-marscms.jpl.nasa.gov/system/resources/detail_files/22365_PIA23151-16.jpg\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nThis image of the flight model of NASA’s Mars Helicopter was taken on Feb. 14, 2019, in a cleanroom at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Its purpose is to confirm that powered flight in the tenuous Martian atmosphere (which has 1% the density of Earth's) is possible and that it can be controlled from Earth over large interplanetary distances. But the helicopter also carries a camera capable of providing high-resolution color images to further demonstrate the vehicle's potential for documenting the Red Planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>Future Mars missions could enlist second-generation helicopters to add an aerial dimension to their explorations. They could investigate previously unvisited or difficult-to-reach destinations such as cliffs, caves and deep craters, act as scouts for human crews or carry small payloads from one location to another. But before any of that happens, a test vehicle has to prove it is possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>In Denver, the Mars Helicopter and its delivery system were checked to make sure that the electrical connections and mechanisms that linked the flight vehicle with its cradle fit snuggly. Then, while still mated, the duo endured the sorts of vibrations they will experience during launch and in-flight operations. The thermal vacuum portion of the testing introduced them to the kinds of extreme temperatures (down to -200 degrees Fahrenheit, or -129 degrees Celsius) that they will encounter in space and on Mars and that could cause components to malfunction or fail.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars Helicopter returned to JPL on May 11, 2019, for further testing and finishing touches. Among the highlights: A new solar panel that will power the helicopter has been installed, and the vehicle's rotor blades have been spun up to ensure that the more than 1,500 individual pieces of carbon fiber, flight-grade aluminum, silicon, copper, foil and <a href='\\\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/aerogels.html\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>aerogel</a> continue to work as a cohesive unit. Of course, there's more testing to come.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"We expect to complete our final tests and refinements and deliver the helicopter to the High Bay 1 clean room for integration with the rover sometime this summer,\\\" said Aung, \\\"but we will never really be done with testing the helicopter until we fly at Mars.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars Helicopter will launch with the Mars 2020 rover on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in July 2020 from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. When it lands in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021, the rover will also be the first spacecraft in the history of planetary exploration with the ability to accurately retarget its point of touchdown during the landing sequence.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. In another first, scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes, and leave them on the planet's surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover and Mars Helicopter for the NASA Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington.

That's why we want to lift the support structure. But we're fairly confident the problem is a lack of friction in the soil.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mole is designed for loose soil to flow around it, providing friction that keeps the mole from bouncing backwards with recoil. The soil around InSight provides much less friction than what we've seen before on Mars. We have several ideas for why this is. One is that the soil compacts and holds together so well that the mole may have created a small cavity around itself while hammering, preventing it from getting the friction it needs to dig. <a href='\\\"https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10212/332_read-33208/#/gallery/34019\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Tests conducted in Germany have confirmed this could happen</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>There's also the possibility that we've hit a rock. The mole was designed to go around smaller rocks — no bigger than a few inches [or centimeters] in size — but it may be pinned between the rock and the support structure. If that's the case, moving the support structure may allow it to keep digging. If it's hit a larger rock, there's not much we can do.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why couldn't the team anticipate the soil issue or hitting a rock?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We always knew there were environmental risks that could stop the mole. What we did is prepare as best we could so that they were calculated risks.</p>\\n\\n<p>The low-friction soil was unexpected: Everywhere else on Mars, soil has been different, which was what the mole was built for. We also knew there would be rocks underground, so we deliberately chose a landing site that was flat and had as few rocks as possible on the surface. Based on what we can see, the chances of hitting a rock this close to the surface that the mole can't go around is only a few percent.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: What will happen once you lift the support structure?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> It depends on what we see. First, we'll try a short hammering sequence with the mole. Then, regardless of whether there's a cavity around the mole, we will likely press on the soil with a small scoop on the robotic arm to provide a load on the surface. Our calculations suggest that this should increase the friction and could help it dig.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: When would that occur?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We hope to lift the support structure by the end of June and to have our next steps decided by mid-July. After that, we will need time to run more tests.</p>\\n\\n<p><i>Engineer-scientist Troy Hudson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the InSight mission.</i></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why are you lifting the support structure in three steps? </b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> There are springs inside of the support structure that may still be in contact with the top of the mole. If that's the case, we want to be careful lifting the structure so that we don't accidentally pull the mole out. If that happened, we won't be able to insert it back into its hole in the soil. So we'll lift the support structure a little bit at a time, checking to make sure the mole isn't coming with it.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why has it taken so much time to plan these next steps?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We don't want to take an action that makes the situation worse, so we've been moving very carefully. InSight is also a Discovery class mission, meaning it was meant to be more affordable — and to accept more risk — than a flagship NASA mission. So the team is very small; we don't command the lander every day, and commands that are sent up need to be rigorously tested to make sure they'll work the way we want them to. We want every action to be safe for HP<sup>3</sup>, the robotic arm <i>and</i> InSight's seismometer, which is very close by.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why can't you just pick up the mole and move it to another spot?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> The robotic arm, which we inherited from another mission, wouldn't be able to pick up the mole. We designed HP<sup>3</sup>'s support structure to be grasped by the arm's grapple, but the mole was never designed to be handled that way.</p>\\n\\n<p>We think the issue is a lack of friction in the soil under InSight. So even if we <i>could</i> pick up the mole, it wouldn't matter where we put it — we would still have the same friction problem. If the issue is a rock, there's no way to guarantee you wouldn't just hit another rock.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

The stack includes the aeroshell as well as a rover stand-in (the real rover is undergoing final assembly in JPL's High Bay 1 cleanroom) and other components. Together, they are assembled, or stacked, in the same configuration as when it launches toward Mars in July 2020.\\n\\n<p>\\\"We test the hardware components with a random noise spectrum in order to replicate a launch environment,\\\" said Andy Rose, manager of the Environmental Test Facilities at JPL. \\\"We reach sound levels as high as 150 decibels, which would really rattle your fillings if you were inside the chamber at the time.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, the technicians waited for each several-minute run to end before opening the chamber door to inspect the spacecraft in their cleanroom attire (the spacecraft must remain contamination-free to adhere to <a href='\\\"https://sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/planetary-protection\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>planetary protection rules</a>). By day's end, the stack had been acoustically tested and inspected six times.

The historic chamber has hosted spacecraft from NASA's Mariner missions of the early 1960s to Voyager and Cassini to all of the Mars rovers. The 2020 stack was suspended from cables so the cold realities of interplanetary cruise could hit the spacecraft from every angle.\\n\\n<p>With the 16-ton door closed, a near-vacuum environment was established. Then, as the Mars 2020 test team looked on, the baffled chamber walls were flooded with liquid nitrogen to chill it to -200 degrees Fahrenheit (-129 degrees Celsius). To simulate the Sun's rays that Mars 2020 will encounter during its voyage, powerful xenon lamps several floors below the chamber illuminated, their light directed onto a mirror at the top of the chamber and reflected down on the spacecraft. Eight days later the lamps were turned off, atmosphere was reintroduced to the chamber, and the door opened. Acoustic and thermal vacuum testing was complete.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"This is the most comprehensive stress test you can put a spacecraft through here on Earth,\\\" said Gruel. \\\"We flew in our simulated space environment for a week and a day, checking and rechecking the performance of every onboard system and subsystem. And everything looked great — which is a good thing, because next time this spacecraft stack hits a vacuum, it will be on its way to Mars for real.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>On May 10, the stack returned yet again to the High Bay 1 cleanroom. Just feet away, technicians worked on the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) Mars 2020 rover that will be part of the stack at launch. The rover already had more than 90% of the components that will make up the interior of the chassis, from the science instruments and computers to subsystems and electrical boxes to the organized tangle of electrical wiring connecting them all.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 2020 rover carries an entirely new suite of instruments, including a sample-caching system that will collect samples of Mars for return to Earth on subsequent missions.

The same way MRO is the primary relay for Curiosity, Odyssey (NASA's longest-lived orbiter) is the primary relay for the agency's latest Martian inhabitant, InSight. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter recently started <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8410/nasas-maven-spacecraft-shrinking-its-mars-orbit-to-prepare-for-mars-2020-rover/\\\"'>changing its orbit</a> in preparation to cover the Mars 2020 rover's entry after it lands in February 2021. After data is sent up to an orbiter, it's beamed to giant antennas at one of three locations around Earth, all of which are part of NASA's <a href='\\\"https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/news/\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Deep Space Network</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>That relay network is now international. The European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter has been carrying an ever-increasing share of data sent from the surface. And all of these orbiters are preparing for the arrival of ESA's Rosalind Franklin ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to land the same year as Mars 2020.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mars Landings</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Orbiters like MRO and Odyssey are snap-happy, constantly imaging potential landing sites for future missions. But after a site has been selected and a mission is sent to Mars, orbiters play another critical role.</p>\\n\\n<p>Before a surface mission can begin conducting science, it has to land safely. Successful landings require clocklike precision so that the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere at just the right angle, the parachute opens at the right time and sensors detect the rapidly approaching surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>MRO and other orbiters serve as black boxes, recording data about each landing, which grow more difficult with the sort of added mass that comes with a mission like Mars 2020. Engineers use the data to design safer missions — which will be key to sending astronauts to Mars. With plans to return astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024, NASA is looking ahead at humans exploring the Red Planet, too.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"column-width image_module\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/resources/detail_files/7741_MRO-infographic-by-the-numbers-may2019-1280.jpg\">\\n<img alt=\"Facts about the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" src=\"/system/resources/detail_files/7741_MRO-infographic-by-the-numbers-may2019-1280.jpg\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter By The Numbers:</b> Over the past decade, the mission has shown how dynamic Mars remains today, as well as how diverse its past environmental conditions have been.

But far more often, passing winds cleared off the rover's solar panels and gave it an energy boost. Those dust clearings allowed Opportunity and its sister rover, Spirit, to survive for years beyond their 90-day expiration dates.</p>\\n\\n<p>Dust clearings are also expected for Mars' newest inhabitant, the InSight lander. Because of the spacecraft's weather sensors, each clearing can provide crucial science data on these events, as well — and the mission already has a glimpse at that.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Feb. 1, the 65th Martian day, or sol, of the mission, InSight detected a passing wind vortex (also known as a dust devil if it picks up dust and becomes visible; InSight's cameras didn't catch the vortex in this case). At the same time, the lander's two large solar panels experienced very small bumps in power — about 0.7% on one panel and 2.7% on the other — suggesting a tiny amount of dust was lifted.</p>\\n\\n<p>Those are whispers compared to cleanings observed by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, where dust-clearing wind gusts occasionally boosted power by as much as 10% and left solar panels visibly cleaner. But the recent event has given scientists their first measurements of wind and dust interacting \\\"live\\\" on the Martian surface; none of NASA's solar-powered rovers have included meteorological sensors that record so much <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8415/insight-is-the-newest-mars-weather-service/?site=insight\\\"'>round-the-clock data</a>. In time, data from dust cleanings could inform the design of solar-powered missions as well as research on how wind sculpts the landscape.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"It didn't make a significant difference to our power output, but this first event is fascinating science,\\\" said InSight science team member Ralph Lorenz of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. \\\"It gives us a starting point for understanding how the wind is driving changes on the surface. We still don't really know how much wind it takes to lift dust on Mars.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Engineers regularly calculate a \\\"dust factor,\\\" a measure of how much dust is covering the panels, when analyzing InSight's solar power. While they saw no change in dust factor around the time of this passing dust devil, they saw a clear increase in electrical current, suggesting it did lift a little bit of dust.</p>\\n\\n<p>Key to measuring these cleanings are InSight's weather sensors, collectively known as the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite, or APSS. During this first dust event, APSS saw a steady increase in wind speed and a sharp drop in air pressure — the signature of a passing dust devil.</p>\\n\\n<p>The wind direction changed by about 180 degrees, which would be expected if a dust devil had passed directly over the lander. APSS measured a peak wind speed of 45 miles per hour (20 meters per second). But it also detected the biggest air pressure drop ever recorded by a Mars surface mission: 9 pascals, or 13% of ambient pressure. That pressure drop suggests there may have been even stronger winds that were too turbulent for sensors to record.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The absolute fastest wind we've directly measured so far from InSight was 63 miles per hour (28 meters per second), so the vortex that lifted dust off our solar panels was among the strongest winds we've seen,\\\" said InSight participating scientist Aymeric Spiga of the Dynamic Meteorology Laboratory at Sorbonne University in Paris. \\\"Without a passing vortex, the winds are more typically between about 4-20 miles per hour (2-10 meters per second), depending on time of day.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This dust lifting happened at 1:33 p.m. local Mars time, which is also consistent with the detection of a dust devil. On both Mars and Earth, the highest levels of dust devil activity are usually seen between about noon and 3 p.m., when the intensity of sunlight is strongest and the ground is hot compared with the air above it.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight landed on Nov. 26, 2018, in Elysium Planitia, a windy region on the Martian equator. The lander has already detected many passing dust devils, and Lorenz said it's likely the spacecraft will see a number of large dust cleanings over the course of its two-year prime mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>Each of InSight's dinner-table-size solar panels has gathered a thin dust layer since landing. Their power output has fallen about 30% since then, due both to dust as well as Mars to moving farther from the Sun. Today the panels produce about 2,700 watt-hours per sol — plenty of energy for daily operations, which require roughly 1,500 watt-hours per sol.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mission's power engineers are still waiting for the kind of dust cleaning Spirit and Opportunity experienced.

The Martian surface is extremely quiet, allowing SEIS, InSight's specially designed seismometer, to pick up faint rumbles. In contrast, Earth's surface is quivering constantly from seismic noise created by oceans and weather. An event of this size in Southern California would be lost among dozens of tiny crackles that occur every day.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"The Martian Sol 128 event is exciting because its size and longer duration fit the profile of moonquakes detected on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions,\\\" said Lori Glaze, Planetary Science Division director at NASA Headquarters.</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA's Apollo astronauts installed five seismometers that measured thousands of quakes while operating on the Moon between 1969 and 1977, revealing seismic activity on the Moon. Different materials can change the speed of seismic waves or reflect them, allowing scientists to use these waves to learn about the interior of the Moon and model its formation. NASA currently is planning to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, laying the foundation that will eventually enable human exploration of Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight's seismometer, which the lander <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight\\\"'>placed on the planet's surface</a> on Dec. 19, 2018, will enable scientists to gather similar data about Mars. By studying the deep interior of Mars, they hope to learn how other rocky worlds, including Earth and the Moon, formed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Three other seismic signals occurred on March 14 (Sol 105), April 10 (Sol 132) and April 11 (Sol 133). Detected by SEIS' more sensitive Very Broad Band sensors, these signals were even smaller than the Sol 128 event and more ambiguous in origin. The team will continue to study these events to try to determine their cause.</p>\\n\\n<p>Regardless of its cause, the Sol 128 signal is an exciting milestone for the team.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"We've been waiting months for a signal like this,\\\" said Philippe Lognonné, SEIS team lead at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) in France. \\\"It's so exciting to finally have proof that Mars is still seismically active. We're looking forward to sharing detailed results once we've had a chance to analyze them.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Most people are familiar with quakes on Earth, which occur on faults created by the motion of tectonic plates. Mars and the Moon do not have tectonic plates, but they still experience quakes – in their cases, caused by a continual process of cooling and contraction that creates stress. This stress builds over time, until it is strong enough to break the crust, causing a quake.</p>\\n\\n<p>Detecting these tiny quakes required a huge feat of engineering. On Earth, high-quality seismometers often are sealed in underground vaults to isolate them from changes in temperature and weather. InSight's instrument has several ingenious <a href='\\\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8407/insights-seismometer-now-has-a-cozy-shelter-on-mars/?site=insight\\\"'>insulating barriers</a>, including a cover built by JPL called the Wind and Thermal Shield, to protect it from the planet's extreme temperature changes and high winds.</p>\\n\\n<p>SEIS has surpassed the team's expectations in terms of its sensitivity. The instrument was provided for InSight by the French space agency, Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES), while these first seismic events were identified by InSight's Marsquake Service team, led by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"We are delighted about this first achievement and are eager to make many similar measurements with SEIS in the years to come,\\\" said Charles Yana, SEIS mission operations manager at CNES.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

But over the past few weeks, some of these components — the spacecraft-rocket-laden landing system and even the stand-in for the rover (christened \\\"surrogate-rover\\\") — have seemingly disappeared.</p>\\n\\n<p>In reality, they are still there, tucked neatly into the entry capsule, as they will be when it's time for launch. The procedure is known as vehicle stacking and involves a hyper-detailed plan for what goes where and when.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"One of our main jobs is to make sure the rover and all the hardware that is required to get the rover from here on Earth to the surface of Mars fits inside the payload fairing of an <span>Atlas V </span>rocket, which gives us about 15 feet [5 meters] of width to work with,\\\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) manager for Mars 2020 at JPL.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first step is to place the rocket-powered descent stage on top of the surrogate rover (the real rover is being integrated and tested in tandem with the spacecraft stack). Then, when all the holes line up and everything is attached, checked and re-checked again, the backshell is lowered over them via gantry crane.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"That crane has lifted almost every spacecraft that's come through JPL since <a href='\\\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mariner-1/\\\"' target='\\\"_blank\\\"'>Mariner</a>,\\\" said Gruel. \\\"To safely lift the large pieces of the Mars 2020 spacecraft, we utilize a dozen technicians and engineers.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After the backshell is in place and everything is determined to be fitting properly, the team puts on the parachute nose cone, which protects the parachute during atmospheric entry, followed by the massive doughnut-shaped cruise stage, which will power the Mars 2020 spacecraft on its seven-month voyage to the Red Planet. Then the vehicle stack is turned on its side so technicians and engineers have access to the mating points between the cruise and descent stages to make connections. The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\\\" said Gruel. \\\"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL's Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Nothing is static with this mission,\\\" said Gruel. \\\"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\\\"  </p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. Scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes and leave them on the planet's surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 Project at JPL manages rover development for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

This was the mission's first sample obtained using only rotation of the drill bit.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\"Curiosity has been on the road for nearly seven years,\\\" said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \\\"Finally drilling at the clay-bearing unit is a major milestone in our journey up Mount Sharp.\\\"</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"column-width image_module\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22403_PIA23137-1280x.jpg\">\\n<img 'waves'=\"\" \\\"=\"\" alt='\\\"Curiosity' clay=\"\" in=\"\" sees=\"\" src=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22403_PIA23137-1280x.jpg\" the=\"\" unit=\"\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Curiosity Sees 'Waves' in the Clay Unit</b>: The hills and troughs in this little valley, carved between a ridge and cliffs higher up Mount Sharp, almost look like undulating waves.

NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spied a strong clay \\\"signal\\\" here long before Curiosity landed in 2012. Pinpointing the source of that signal could help the science team understand if a wetter Martian era shaped this layer of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain Curiosity has been climbing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity has discovered clay minerals in mudstones all along its journey. These mudstones formed as river sediment settled within ancient lakes nearly 3.5 billion years ago. As with water elsewhere on Mars, the lakes eventually dried up.</p>\\n\\n<p>The clay beacon seen from space brought the rover here, but the region clearly has several other stories to tell. Now that Curiosity is searching this area, scientists can peer around as geological tourists, finding a landscape both ancient and new. There are several kinds of bedrock and sand, including active sand ripples that have shifted in the past year. Pebbles are scattered everywhere — are they eroding from the local bedrock? Several eye-catching landmarks, such as \\\"Knockfarril Hill,\\\" stick out as well.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\"column-width image_module\" style=\"\">\\n<figure class=\"inline_figure\">\\n<a class=\"inline_image_enlarge fancybox\" href=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22405_PIA23139-1280x.jpg\">\\n<img 'clay-bearing=\"\" alt='\\\"Curiosity' src=\"/system/resources/detail_files/22405_PIA23139-1280x.jpg\" surveys=\"\" the=\"\" unit'\\\"=\"\"/>\\n<div class=\"enlarge_icon\"></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Curiosity Surveys the 'Clay-Bearing Unit'</b>: The Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover captured this mosaic as it explored the clay-bearing unit on February 3, 2019 (Sol 2309).

It has traveled a total of 13 miles (21 kilometers) and ascended 1,207 feet (368 meters) to its current location.

That clay signal was first detected from space by NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) a few years before Curiosity launched. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"This area is one of the reasons we came to Gale Crater,\" said Kristen Bennett of the U.S. Geological Survey, one of the co-leads for Curiosity\\'s clay-unit campaign. \"We\\'ve been studying orbiter images of this area for 10 years, and we\\'re finally able to take a look up close.\"</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\'column-width embedded_video video_player_container\\'>\\n<div class=\\'video_wrapper\\'>\\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJzDNgs7Db8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars Rover Explores Teal Ridge (360 View): </b>Curiosity captured this 360-degree panorama of a location on Mars called &ldquo;Teal Ridge&rdquo; on June 18, 2019.

But Curiosity has detected similarly high amounts of clay on other parts of Mount Sharp, including in areas where MRO didn\\'t detect clay. That\\'s led scientists to wonder what is causing the findings from orbit and the surface to differ. </p>\\n\\n<p>The science team is thinking through possible reasons as to why the clay minerals here stood out to MRO. The rover encountered a \"parking lot full of gravel and pebbles\" when it first entered the area, said the campaign\\'s other co-lead, Valerie Fox of Caltech. One idea is that the pebbles are the key: Although the individual pebbles are too small for MRO to see, they may collectively appear to the orbiter as a single clay signal scattered across the area. Dust also settles more readily over flat rocks than it does over the pebbles; that same dust can obscure the signals seen from space. The pebbles were too small for Curiosity to drill into, so the science team is looking for other clues to solve this puzzle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity exited the pebble parking lot back in June and started to encounter more complex geologic features. It stopped to take a 360-degree panorama at an outcrop called \"Teal Ridge.\" More recently, it took detailed images of \"Strathdon,\" a rock made of dozens of sediment layers that have hardened into a brittle, wavy heap. Unlike the thin, flat layers associated with lake sediments Curiosity has studied, the wavy layers in these features suggest a more dynamic environment. Wind, flowing water or both could have shaped this area.</p>\\n\\n<p><span><div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/internal_resources/details/original/707_Mastcam_Views_%22Strathdon%22.jpeg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Mastcam Views \"Strathdon\"\\' src=\\'/internal_resources/707\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n</span><b>Mastcam Views \"Strathdon\": </b><span>This mosaic of images shows a boulder-sized rock called \"Strathdon,\" which is made up of many complex layers.

Instead of a linear process, the history of water was more complicated.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity is discovering a richer, more complex story behind the water on Mount Sharp &mdash; a process Fox likened to finally being able to read the paragraphs in a book &mdash; a dense book, with pages torn out, but a fascinating tale to piece together.</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, leads the Mars Science Laboratory mission that includes Curiosity.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more about NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover mission, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</b></a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://nasa.gov/msl\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://nasa.gov/msl</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Andrew Good</b><br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Alana Johnson</b><br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

Engineers installed the first batch of items delivered by MEDLI2 onto the heat shield of the entry vehicle this week. The aeroshell of the entry vehicle consists of a heat shield and backshell and will protect the Mars 2020 rover in transit from Earth to Mars and during the entry through the atmosphere of Mars on its way to the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Understanding the actual performance of our current generation of entry vehicles is crucial to safe, reliable landing of future robotic and crewed Mars missions. MEDLI2 pressure and thermal measurements are the key to that understanding,\" said Todd White, MEDLI2 principal investigator.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 recently completed environmental testing on flight hardware at NASA\\'s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The testing, including vibration and thermal vacuum testing, demonstrates the ability of the hardware to survive the large vibratory loads experienced during the launch and the extreme cold during the cruise to Mars. High-temperature sterilization of some of the hardware has also been successfully concluded, allowing MEDLI2 to minimize the potential of transporting terrestrial biological material unintentionally to the surface of Mars. All of the MEDLI2 components are set to be completely installed on the Mars 2020 aeroshell by the end of November 2019.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 includes three types of sensors (thermocouples, heat flux sensors and pressure transducers), a data acquisition and signal conditioning unit (the Sensor Support Electronics Unit) to record the heating and atmospheric pressure experienced during entry and through parachute deployment, and the harnessing between the sensors and the Sensor Support Electronics unit. Building on the first <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/medli/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">MEDLI</a> suite, which flew on <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\">NASA\\'s Mars Science Laboratory mission</a>, instrumentation is again being applied to the heat shield, but in a different configuration to better measure the flow characteristics. This time instrumentation is being installed on the backshell as well to collect measurements of the heating and the surface pressure to aid in reducing the large uncertainty applied to the current predicted results.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 spacecraft will enter Mars\\' atmosphere traveling about 12,500 mph (20,120 kph). MEDLI2 will start to collect data about five hours prior to the entry and continue to collect data throughout the entry and part of the descent phases. It will take about 6 minutes to slow the spacecraft from 12,500 mph (20,120 kph) to just under 2 mph (3 kph). MEDLI2 will measure crucial entry and descent performance data on the Mars 2020 heat shield and backshell.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 flight data will fill critical space entry, descent and landing knowledge gaps which would advance current EDL technology. This technology also has the potential to reduce TPS mass by up to 35%, which would result in significant cost reductions. This technology and data will also help reduce the size of the landed footprint (the uncertainty footprint) allowing access to sites with high scientific interest that might otherwise be difficult to reach.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Uncertainties in our ability to model and predict the performance of an entry vehicle and the associated thermal protection system mean that large margins (100% to 200%) need to be included in our predictions to ensure the entry vehicle can survive the worst case conditions,\" said Henry Wright, MEDLI2 project manager. \"Flight data will allow the uncertainties in the models to be further reduced leading to a more accurate prediction of the loads and performance.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The key objectives of MEDLI2 are to reduce design margin and prediction uncertainties for the aerothermal environments and aerodynamic database. Close analysis of MEDLI2 flight data is vital to future NASA exploration of the Red Planet. MEDLI2 will explore areas not addressed during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission and seek answers to questions generated from examining MEDLI/MSL data.</p>\\n\\n<p>MEDLI2 is a <a href=\"https://gameon.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Game Changing Development</a> project led by <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/home/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">NASA\\'s Space Technology Mission Directorate</a> with support from the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate</a> and the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Science Mission Directorate</a>.

The excess heat from the generator can also serve to keep spacecraft systems warm in cold environments. In all, 27 past U.S. space missions have used radioisotope power &mdash; from the Viking missions on Mars to the Voyager spacecraft <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-voyager-2-probe-enters-interstellar-space\" target=\"_blank\">entering interplanetary space</a> to, most recently, the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\">Curiosity rover</a> on Mars and the <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/new-horizons/in-depth/\" target=\"_blank\">New Horizons</a> spacecraft that sailed past Pluto.</p>\\n\\n<p>MMRTGs work by converting heat from the natural decay of radioisotope materials into electricity. The generators consist of two major elements: a heat source that contains plutonium-238 (Pu-238) and thermocouples that convert the plutonium\\'s decay heat energy to electricity. The Department of Energy (DOE) provides radioisotope power systems to NASA for civil space applications and will insert the fuel into the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal Generator at the DOE\\'s Idaho National Laboratory. The mission&rsquo;s MMRTG will later be shipped directly from the Idaho facility to the launch site at Cape Canaveral, Florida, for integration into the rover. The process of loading the heat source into the MMRTG is timed to a mission\\'s launch date. The Mars 2020 fueling process has been initiated thanks to the continued progress constructing the rover and the spacecraft that will get it there.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We are advancing on all fronts &mdash; including completion of the cruise stage that will guide us to Mars and the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/#Mars2020-Technology\">sky crane</a> descent landing system that will gently lower us to the surface,\" said Project Manager John McNamee of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission in Pasadena, California. \"And the rover is not only looking more and more like a rover each day, it\\'s acting like one.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>With the exception of incorporating the Adaptive Caching Assembly, with its seven motors and more than 3,000 parts, work on the Mars 2020 rover\\'s interior is 100% complete.

       "   'body': '<p>Southern California got all shook up after a set of recent quakes. But Earth isn\\'t the only place that experiences quakes: Both the Moon and Mars have them as well. NASA sent the first seismometer to the Moon 50 years ago, during the Apollo 11 mission; the agency\\'s InSight lander brought the first seismometer to Mars in late 2018, and it\\'s called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>Provided by the French space agency, Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES), the seismometer detected its <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8430/nasas-insight-detects-first-likely-quake-on-mars/?site=insight\">first marsquake</a> on April 6, 2019. The InSight mission\\'s Marsquake Service, which monitors the data from SEIS, is led by Swiss research university ETH Zurich.</p>\\n\\n<p>Quakes look and feel different depending on the material their seismic waves pass through. In a new video, scientists at ETH demonstrate this by using data from the Apollo-era seismometers on the Moon, two of the first quakes detected on Mars by SEIS and quakes recorded here on Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>By running data from these worlds through a quake simulator, or \"shake room,\" scientists can experience for themselves how different the earthquakes can be. Researchers had to amplify the marsquake signals by a factor of 10 million in order to make the quiet and distant tremors perceptible in comparison to the similarly amplified moonquakes and unamplified earthquakes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Fifty years after Apollo 11 astronauts deployed the first seismometer on the surface of the Moon, NASA InSight\\'s seismic experiment transmits data giving researchers the opportunity to compare marsquakes to moon and earthquakes. The Marsquake Service (MQS) center at ETH Zurich in Switzerland monitors daily seismic activity on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA\\'s Discovery Program, managed by the agency\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

CNES provided the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument to NASA, with the principal investigator at IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris). Significant contributions for SEIS came from IPGP; the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Switzerland; Imperial College London and Oxford University in the United Kingdom; and JPL. DLR provided the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>) instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland.

       "   'body': '<p>Raising crops on Mars is far easier in science fiction than it will be in real life: The Red Planet is an inhospitable world. Among other challenges, subzero temperatures mean water can persist on the surface only as ice, and the planet\\'s atmosphere offers little protection to plants (or people) from the Sun\\'s radiation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, NASA has plans to eventually put humans on Mars, using lessons it will learn from its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/specials/moon2mars/\" target=\"_blank\">Artemis lunar explorations</a>. And those humans will need to eat. Being able to produce food on Mars would help reduce the quantity of supplies consuming valuable space and fuel on crewed missions to the Red Planet. But figuring out how &mdash; and where &mdash; to produce that food, while also being exceedingly careful not to contaminate Mars with Earth-borne bacteria, are some of the challenges scientists and engineers face.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a new paper in Nature Astronomy, researchers propose that a material called aerogel might help humans one day build greenhouses and other habitats at Mars\\' mid-latitudes, where near-surface water ice has been identified. The study was funded by Harvard University\\'s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>\\n\\n<p>Aerogel is a Styrofoam-like solid that is 99% air, making it extremely light. It&rsquo;s adept at preventing the transfer of heat as well, making it an excellent insulator; in fact, it\\'s been used for that purpose on all of NASA\\'s Mars rovers. Moreover, aerogel is translucent, allowing visible light to pass through while blocking ultraviolet light\\'s harmful radiation. Most aerogel is made from silica, the same material found in glass.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22657_PIA23342-16.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Scientists tested these samples of aerogel to see how they could be used as building materials on Mars.\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22657_PIA23342-16.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nAerogel Samples: Scientists tested these samples of aerogel to see how they could be used as building materials on Mars. Credit: Robin Wordsworth/Harvard. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22657/\">Full image and caption &rsaquo;</a>\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>In an experiment conducted by lead author Robin Wordsworth of Harvard, 2-3 centimeters of silica aerogel allowed light from a lamp tuned to simulate Martian sunlight to heat the surface beneath it by up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius) &mdash; enough to raise temperatures on the Martian surface and melt water ice.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The study was meant as an initial test of aerogel\\'s potential as a Martian building material,\" said second author Laura Kerber, a geologist at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p>\\n\\n<p>Kerber participated in a 2015 NASA workshop to identify the best places on Mars to send astronauts. \"The ideal place for a Martian outpost would have plentiful water and moderate temperatures,\" she said. \"Mars is warmer around the equator, but most of the water ice is located at higher latitudes. Building with silica aerogel would allow us to artificially create warm environments where there is already water ice available.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Broadening the regions on Mars where humans could grow things also opens up new areas where they could conduct valuable scientific research, Kerber added.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>\\'Dark Spots\\' on Mars</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The aerogel experiment was inspired by the heating process that creates so-called dark spots that dot Mars\\' carbon dioxide ice caps during the spring. This kind of ice is better known on Earth as dry ice. Like aerogel, carbon dioxide ice is translucent, allowing sunlight to heat the surface below. As the soil warms, carbon dioxide gas accumulates between the ice and the warm surface, eventually causing the ice to rupture. That, in turn, creates a puff of gas that tosses soil beneath the ice onto its surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>The experiment explored a similar process with aerogel. The paper details how both a solid piece of aerogel as well as chunks of crushed aerogel can be used to heat the surface below. The researchers used varying levels of illumination produced by Martian seasons. The results suggest aerogel could even provide a heating effect in the bitter Martian winter. In the mid-latitudes, winter nighttime temperatures can be as cold as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius).</p>\\n\\n<p>The next step, Wordsworth said, is taking the experiment out of the lab and into Martian analogues like Chile\\'s Atacama Desert or Antarctica\\'s McMurdo Dry Valleys. Like Mars, these environments reach subzero temperatures and are exceptionally dry.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Our prediction is that aerogel shielding should provide more efficient heating as it scales in size,\" Wordsworth said. \"That would be important to see under field conditions.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Challenges to Be Overcome</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While the experiment was an encouraging proof of concept, Wordsworth acknowledged there are still significant engineering challenges to overcome. Based on a climate model produced along with the experiment, it would take lots of aerogel and at least two Mars years (or four Earth years) of warming to produce a permanent region of liquid water underneath. Although aerogel is several times lighter than air, building structures with roofs made out of the material would require shipping large quantities of it to Mars or somehow manufacturing it there.</p>\\n\\n<p>Silica aerogel is very fragile and porous; layering it within another translucent material, or combining it with flexible materials, could prevent fracturing. Doing so could increase air pressure under a structure made with an aerogel roof or shield as well, allowing liquid water to pool more easily on the surface instead of vaporizing in the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p>But the study\\'s authors noted that developing small habitability zones on Mars is more plausible than attempting to \"terraform\" the planet, as science-fiction writers have proposed doing in the past. A <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8358/mars-terraforming-not-possible-using-present-day-technology/\">NASA study</a> last year dashed the hopes of thickening the Martian atmosphere enough to create an Earth-like greenhouse effect.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Anything that would help make long-term habitability possible is exciting to consider,\" Wordsworth said.</p>\\n\\n<p>More information about NASA\\'s Mars program is at:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mars\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nasa.gov/mars</a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/\">https://mars.nasa.gov/</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

It will touch down on Feb. 18, 2021, in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) expanse full of steep cliffs, boulder fields and other things that could boobytrap the landing. A new technology called Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) will allow the spacecraft to avoid hazards autonomously.

They had hoped to send the lunar module Eagle toward a relatively flat landing zone with few craters, rocks and boulders. Instead, peering through his small, triangular commander\\'s window, Armstrong saw a boulder field &mdash; very unfriendly for a lunar module. So the Apollo 11 commander took control of the descent from the onboard computer, piloting Eagle well beyond the boulder field, to a landing site that will forever be known as Tranquility Base.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"There had been Moon landings with robotic spacecraft before Apollo 11,\" said Al Chen, entry, descent and landing lead for NASA\\'s Mars 2020 mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"But never before had a spacecraft on a descent toward its surface changed its trajectory to maneuver out of harm\\'s way.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Chen and his Mars 2020 colleagues have experience landing spacecraft on the Red Planet without the help of a steely-eyed astronaut at the stick. But Mars 2020 is headed toward NASA\\'s biggest Martian challenge yet. <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8387/nasa-announces-landing-site-for-mars-2020-rover/\">Jezero Crater</a> is a 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) indentation full of steep cliffsides, sand dunes, boulders fields and small impact craters. The team knew that to attempt a landing at Jezero &mdash; and with a rover carrying 50% more payload than the Curiosity rover, which landed at a more benign location near Mount Sharp &mdash; they would have to up their game.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"What we needed was a Neil Armstrong for Mars,\" said Chen. \"What we came up with was Terrain-Relative Navigation.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Carried aboard Mars 2020, Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN) is an autopilot that during landing can quickly figure out the spacecraft\\'s location over &mdash; and more importantly, calculate its future location on &mdash; the Martian surface. Onboard, the rover\\'s computer stores a map of hazards within Jezero Crater, and if the computed landing point is deemed too dangerous, TRN will command Mars 2020\\'s descent stage to fly the rover to the safest reachable landing point.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>A Two-Part System</b></p>\\n\\n<p>To land an Apollo lunar module on the Moon required a crew of two (Armstrong had Buzz Aldrin feeding him information on their trajectory). Likewise, Terrain-Relative Navigation is actually two systems working together: the Lander Vision System and the Safe Target Selection system.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The first half of Terrain-Relative Navigation is the Lander Vision System [LVS], which determines where the spacecraft is over the Martian surface,\" said Andrew Johnson, guidance navigation and control subsystem manager for Mars 2020. \"If you say it quick &mdash; LVS &mdash; you\\'ll understand why the team\\'s unofficial mascot is Elvis Presley.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>LVS\\'s operational lifetime is all of 25 seconds. It comes alive at about 13,000 feet (3,960 meters), commanding a camera on the rover to quickly take picture after picture of the Martian surface while still descending on a parachute. LVS scrutinizes one image a second, breaking each into squares that cover about 5,000 feet (1,520 meters) of surface area.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, unlike Neil Armstrong, LVS\\'s real-time analysis isn\\'t looking for specific crater rims or mountain peaks. Instead, inside each of those boxes, or landmarks, the system looks for unique patterns in contrasting light and dark created by surface features like cliffs, craters, boulder fields and mountains. It then compares any uncommon pattern with a map in its memory. When it finds five landmark matches during Coarse Landmark Matching mode, it takes another image and repeats the process.</p>\\n\\n<p>After three successful image-to-map comparisons, LVS kicks into a mode called Fine Landmark Matching. That\\'s when the system breaks the surface into boxes 410 feet (125 meters) across, scanning for unique patterns and comparing them with the map. LVS is looking for at least 20 matches in that one second of eyeballing an image but usually makes much more &mdash; up to 150 &mdash; in order to generate an even more accurate plot of Mars 2020\\'s trajectory.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Each time a suitable number of matches is made in an image, in either Course or Fine Landmark Matching, LVS updates where the spacecraft is at that moment,\" said Johnson. \"That update is then fed into the Safe Target Selection system.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This second part of the Terrain-Relative Navigation system uses LVS\\'s position solution, calculates where it will land and then compares it to another onboard map, this one depicting areas within the landing zone understood to be either good for landing &hellip; or the kind with craters, cliffsides, boulders or rocks fields. If the plotted location isn\\'t suitable, Safe Target Selection can change the rover\\'s destiny, moving its landing point by up to 2,000 feet (600 meters).</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Put to the Test</b></p>\\n\\n<p>While Safe Target Selection operations can be investigated in a computer testbed within the confines of JPL, to gather optical data, the team needed to go farther afield: the Mojave Desert and Death Valley.</p>\\n\\n<p>Over three weeks in April and May of 2019, LVS flew 17 flights attached to the front of a helicopter, taking and processing image after image over the Mars-like terrain of Kelso Dunes, Hole-in-the-Wall, Lava Tube, Badwater, Panamint Valley and Mesquite Flat Dunes.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We flew flight after flight, imitating the descent profile of the spacecraft,\" said Johnson. \"In each flight we performed multiple runs. Each run essentially imitated a Mars landing.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>All in all, the equivalent of 659 Mars landings took place during the test flights.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The data is in &mdash; TRN works,\" said Chen. \"Which is a good thing because Jezero is where our scientists want to be. And without TRN, the odds of successful landing at a good location for the rover are approximately 85%. With TRN, we feel confident we are up around 99%.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>But Chen is also quick to note that Mars is hard: Only about 40% of all missions sent to Mars &mdash; by any space agency &mdash; have successfully landed.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"To go farther we have to look to the past, and in that respect who better than the first?\" said Chen. \"In an interview some 35 years after Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong said, \\'I think we tried very hard not to be overconfident. Because when you get overconfident, that\\'s when something snaps up and bites you.\\'\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Mindful of that, the Mars 2020 TRN team\\'s work will conclude only on Feb. 18, 2021, a little after 12 p.m. PST (3 p.m. EST), when their rover alights on Jezero Crater. But it is also just a beginning: Terrain-Relative Navigation\\'s autonomous precision guidance could prove essential to landing humans safely on both the Moon and Mars. TRN could also be useful for landing equipment in multiple drops ahead of a human crew on either world &mdash; or others to be explored down the road.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL is building and will manage operations of the Mars 2020 rover for the NASA Science Mission Directorate at the agency\\'s headquarters in Washington.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to send your name to Mars with NASA\\'s 2020 mission, you can do so until Sept. 30, 2019.

Last week, the spacecraft\\'s robotic arm successfully removed the support structure of the mole, which has been unable to dig, and placed it to the side. Getting the structure out of the way gives the mission team a view of the mole &mdash; and maybe a way to help it dig.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'ve completed the first step in our plan to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8445/insights-team-tries-new-strategy-to-help-the-mole/?site=insight\">save the mole</a>,\" said Troy Hudson of a scientist and engineer with the InSight mission at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"We\\'re not done yet.

Based on DLR testing, the soil may not provide the kind of friction the mole was designed for. Without friction to balance the recoil from the self-hammering motion, the mole would simply bounce in place rather than dig.</p>\\n\\n<p>One sign of this unexpected soil type is apparent in images taken by a camera on the robotic arm: A small pit has formed around the mole as it\\'s been hammering in place.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The images coming back from Mars confirm what we\\'ve seen in our testing here on Earth,\" said HP<sup>3</sup> Project Scientist Mattias Grott of DLR. \"Our calculations were correct: This cohesive soil is compacting into walls as the mole hammers.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The team wants to press on the soil near this pit using a small scoop on the end of the robotic arm. The hope is that this might collapse the pit and provide the necessary friction for the mole to dig.</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s also still possible that the mole has hit a rock. While the mole is designed to push small rocks out of the way or deflect around them, larger ones will prevent the spike\\'s forward progress. That\\'s why the mission carefully selected a landing site that would likely have both fewer rocks in general and smaller ones near the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>The robotic arm\\'s grapple isn\\'t designed to lift the mole once it\\'s out of its support structure, so it won\\'t be able to relocate the mole if a rock is blocking it.</p>\\n\\n<p>The team will be discussing what next steps to take based on careful analysis. Later this month, after releasing the arm\\'s grapple from the support structure, they\\'ll bring a camera in for some detailed images of the mole.</p>\\n\\n<p>A Q&A with team members about the mole and the effort to save it is at: <br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8444/common-questions-about-insights-mole/?site=insight\">https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8444/common-questions-about-insights-mole/?site=insight</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

       "   'body': '<p><b>Updated at 5 p.m. PDT (8 p.m. EDT) on June 24, 2019 </b></p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity\\'s team conducted a follow-on methane experiment this past weekend. The results came down early Monday morning: The methane levels have sharply decreased, with less than 1 part per billion by volume detected. That\\'s a value close to the background levels Curiosity sees all the time.</p>\\n\\n<p>The finding suggests last week\\'s methane detection &mdash; the largest amount of the gas Curiosity has ever found &mdash; was one of the transient methane plumes that have been observed in the past. While scientists have observed the background levels rise and fall seasonally, they haven\\'t found a pattern in the occurrence of these transient plumes.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The methane mystery continues,\" said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\\'s project scientist at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"We\\'re more motivated than ever to keep measuring and put our brains together to figure out how methane behaves in the Martian atmosphere.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity doesn\\'t have instruments that can definitively say whether the source of the methane is biological or geological. A clearer understanding of these plumes, combined with coordinated measurements from other missions, could help scientists determine where they\\'re located on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity\\'s most recent methane findings will be announced during a livestream of the 5 p.m. PDT / 8 p.m. EDT NASA Town Hall at AbSciCon 2019, an astrobiology science conference happening in Bellevue, Washington. Watch the plenary broadcast at:</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://connect.agu.org/abscicon/home\">https://connect.agu.org/abscicon/home</a></p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p><b>Original story posted June 23, 2019</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Curiosity Detects Unusually High Methane Levels</b></p>\\n\\n<p>This week, NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover found a surprising result: the largest amount of methane ever measured during the mission &mdash; about 21 parts per billion units by volume (ppbv). One ppbv means that if you take a volume of air on Mars, one billionth of the volume of air is methane.</p>\\n\\n<p>The finding came from the rover\\'s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) tunable laser spectrometer. It\\'s exciting because microbial life is an important source of methane on Earth, but methane can also be created through interactions between <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/methane-stinks-earth-mars-and-beyond\" target=\"_blank\">rocks and water</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity doesn\\'t have instruments that can definitively say what the source of the methane is, or even if it\\'s coming from a local source within Gale Crater or elsewhere on the planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,\" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA\\'s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Curiosity team has <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/16dec_methanespike\" target=\"_blank\">detected methane</a> many times over the course of the mission. Previous papers have documented how background levels of the gas seem to <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8347/nasa-finds-ancient-organic-material-mysterious-methane-on-mars/\">rise and fall seasonally</a>. They\\'ve also noted sudden spikes of methane, but the science team knows very little about how long these transient plumes last or why they\\'re different from the seasonal patterns.</p>\\n\\n<p>The SAM team organized a different experiment for this weekend to gather more information on what might be a transient plume. Whatever they find &mdash; even if it\\'s an absence of methane &mdash; will add context to the recent measurement.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity\\'s scientists need time to analyze these clues and conduct many more methane observations. They also need time to collaborate with other science teams, including those with the European Space Agency\\'s Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been in its science orbit for a little over a year without detecting any methane. Combining observations from the surface and from orbit could help scientists locate sources of the gas on the planet and understand how long it lasts in the Martian atmosphere. That might explain why the Trace Gas Orbiter\\'s and Curiosity\\'s methane observations have been so different.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information about Curiosity, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html</b></a><br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\"><b>https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</b></a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Alana Johnson<br />\\nNASA Headquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1501<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov\">alana.r.johnson@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

There\\'s no water on the surface to drink, either. The landscape is freezing, with no protection from the Sun\\'s radiation or from passing dust storms. The keys to survival will be technology, research and testing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars 2020 will help on all those fronts. When it launches in July of 2020, the spacecraft will carry the latest scientific and engineering tools, which are coming together as <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/where-is-the-rover/\">the rover is built</a> at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Here\\'s a closer look.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Touchdown</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Every landing on Mars offers a learning opportunity. With Mars 2020, that includes how the spacecraft\\'s heat shield and <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8380/third-aspire-test-confirms-mars-2020-parachute-a-go/\">parachute</a> perform in the planet\\'s atmosphere, and how well its radar can sense the approaching surface. Sensors in the spacecraft\\'s aeroshell (the capsule that encloses the rover) will study how it heats up and performs during atmospheric entry. These <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/#MEDLI2\">Mars Entry, Descent and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2)</a> sensors could help engineers improve their landing designs for big payloads like astronaut equipment and habitats.</p>\\n\\n<p>Landing a rover like this one also gives NASA more experience putting a heavy spacecraft on the surface of Mars; the challenge of landing in the thin Martian atmosphere scales with mass. The first crewed spacecraft will be titanic by comparison, carrying with it life support systems, supplies and shielding.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, Mars 2020 has a guidance system that will take a step toward safer landings. Called <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/\">Terrain Relative Navigation</a>, this new system figures out where the spacecraft is headed by taking camera images during descent and matching landmarks in them to a preloaded map.

Those would allow astronauts to create their own breathable air and would provide oxygen to burn rocket fuel needed to return humans to the Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>More importantly, MOXIE\\'s descendants would save precious space on the first crewed vehicle to Mars.

Dust blows everywhere, sticking to spacecraft and covering solar panels. And because the planet doesn\\'t have a magnetic field, as Earth does, the Sun\\'s radiation bathes the Martian surface. The orbits of Earth and Mars align best for interplanetary travel every two years, meaning the first astronauts on the Red Planet are likely to endure long exposures to radiation.</p>\\n\\n<p>To help engineers design spacesuits to shield astronauts from the elements, NASA is sending five samples of spacesuit material along with one of Mars 2020\\'s science instruments, called <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/sherloc/\">Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC)</a>.

Scientists will use SHERLOC, as well as a camera that photographs visible light, to study how the materials degrade in ultraviolet radiation. It will mark the first time spacesuit material has been sent to Mars for testing and will provide a vital comparison for ongoing testing at NASA\\'s Johnson Space Center.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Shelter</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Humans exploring the Red Planet will need more than good spacesuits; they\\'ll need a place to live. Mars 2020 will collect science that may help engineers design better shelters for future astronauts.

       "   'body': '<p>Next summer, NASA is launching the Mars 2020 robotic rover to the Red Planet, loaded with equipment to search for signs that there once was life on Mars. One device, called the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/sherloc/\">Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals</a> (SHERLOC) instrument, will be used to detect chemicals on the Martian surface that are linked to the existence of life. To keep the instrument working well, a team from the <a href=\"https://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science</a> (ARES) division at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center (JSC) recently built a new calibration device for the rover to check SHERLOC&rsquo;s function and properly tune it during the upcoming mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;SHERLOC is pretty complicated, and we came up with a list of 11 things that all have to be calibrated on this instrument,&rdquo; said Marc Fries, ARES planetary scientist and Mars 2020 instrument co-investigator. &ldquo;This sophisticated calibration device is also going to be used for a lot of other scientific and engineering investigations, and we&rsquo;re really excited that it&rsquo;s JSC&rsquo;s contribution to the Mars 2020 rover.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p><b>On Target</b></p>\\n\\n<p>SHERLOC is mounted on the end of the rover\\'s seven-foot robotic arm and includes a laser, camera and chemical analyzers, called spectrometers. The sensitive components will be used together to search for substances that have been altered by water and possibly reveal evidence of past microscopic life on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;The rover&rsquo;s scientific instruments go through all sorts of harsh conditions from the time they leave the lab until they arrive on the surface of Mars. SHERLOC needed a way to make sure it still operates as expected once it&rsquo;s on the surface and throughout the duration of the mission,&rdquo; said Trevor Graff, a scientist from Jacobs who works for ARES.</p>\\n\\n<p>The solution was to create the calibration target, or &ldquo;cal target&rdquo; for short. The device is approximately the size of a large cell phone and mounted on the front of the rover. On its face are 10 &ldquo;targets,&rdquo; which consist of samples of different materials. The idea is that researchers will occasionally check SHERLOC&rsquo;s function by directing it to scan the different materials on the cal target. The researchers will already know what the readings on those materials should be when SHERLOC is working correctly. If the actual readings are off, they&rsquo;ll make adjustments to SHERLOC to get it set properly, or know to compensate for the errors when they analyze the data later.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22534_sherloc3-team-web.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Image of engineers with the Mars 2020 SHERLOC Calibration Target in a clean room at NASA\\'s Johnson Space Center.\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22534_sherloc3-team-web.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\nThis is the first Mars flight hardware that has been designed, assembled & tested at NASA-Johnson Space Center, led by Jacobs/JETS Chief Scientist Trevor Graff.

For example, a number of the targets hold spacesuit materials that could one day be used to protect astronauts exploring Mars. SHERLOC&rsquo;s scans of those materials will not only help tune the instrument, but measure how the advanced fabrics and other suit materials will hold up in the Martian environment, too.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;We also plan to build a small Mars exposure instrument here at JSC, and match the conditions inside it with weather data from the rover,&rdquo; Fries said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll then place an identical set of spacesuit samples inside the chamber and periodically remove them to, for example, test the strength of fabrics or the clarity of helmet visor plastics. The result is we&rsquo;ll be able to test spacesuit materials in Mars-like conditions long before astronauts ever go there.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>Another target contains an actual sample of a meteorite ejected from Mars long ago and discovered on Earth in 1999. Researchers plan to closely watch the rock sample to see how the Martian environment alters it over time, which will help them understand the chemical interactions between the planet&rsquo;s surface and its atmosphere.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, the target includes the first off-planet &ldquo;cache&rdquo; for geocaching enthusiasts to locate, with more details on that to be released soon.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information on SHERLOC and the upcoming mission to Mars, visit the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/\">Mars 2020 Rover homepage</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><i>Charlie Plain</i></p>\\n\\n<p><i>Johnson Space Center</i></p>\\n',\n",

Its purpose is to confirm that powered flight in the tenuous Martian atmosphere (which has 1% the density of Earth\\'s) is possible and that it can be controlled from Earth over large interplanetary distances. But the helicopter also carries a camera capable of providing high-resolution color images to further demonstrate the vehicle\\'s potential for documenting the Red Planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>Future Mars missions could enlist second-generation helicopters to add an aerial dimension to their explorations. They could investigate previously unvisited or difficult-to-reach destinations such as cliffs, caves and deep craters, act as scouts for human crews or carry small payloads from one location to another. But before any of that happens, a test vehicle has to prove it is possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>In Denver, the Mars Helicopter and its delivery system were checked to make sure that the electrical connections and mechanisms that linked the flight vehicle with its cradle fit snuggly. Then, while still mated, the duo endured the sorts of vibrations they will experience during launch and in-flight operations. The thermal vacuum portion of the testing introduced them to the kinds of extreme temperatures (down to -200 degrees Fahrenheit, or -129 degrees Celsius) that they will encounter in space and on Mars and that could cause components to malfunction or fail.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars Helicopter returned to JPL on May 11, 2019, for further testing and finishing touches. Among the highlights: A new solar panel that will power the helicopter has been installed, and the vehicle\\'s rotor blades have been spun up to ensure that the more than 1,500 individual pieces of carbon fiber, flight-grade aluminum, silicon, copper, foil and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/aerogels.html\" target=\"_blank\">aerogel</a> continue to work as a cohesive unit. Of course, there\\'s more testing to come.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We expect to complete our final tests and refinements and deliver the helicopter to the High Bay 1 clean room for integration with the rover sometime this summer,\" said Aung, \"but we will never really be done with testing the helicopter until we fly at Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars Helicopter will launch with the Mars 2020 rover on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in July 2020 from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. When it lands in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021, the rover will also be the first spacecraft in the history of planetary exploration with the ability to accurately retarget its point of touchdown during the landing sequence.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers.

The following Q&As with two members of the team answer some of the most common questions about the burrowing device, part of a science instrument called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP<sup>3</sup>).</p>\\n\\n<p><i>HP<sup>3</sup> Principal Investigator Tilman Spohn of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), which provided the instrument.</i></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: What do you suspect is preventing the mole from digging further?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We don\\'t know for sure, because we can\\'t see underground. That\\'s why we want to lift the support structure. But we\\'re fairly confident the problem is a lack of friction in the soil.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mole is designed for loose soil to flow around it, providing friction that keeps the mole from bouncing backwards with recoil. The soil around InSight provides much less friction than what we\\'ve seen before on Mars. We have several ideas for why this is. One is that the soil compacts and holds together so well that the mole may have created a small cavity around itself while hammering, preventing it from getting the friction it needs to dig. <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10212/332_read-33208/#/gallery/34019\" target=\"_blank\">Tests conducted in Germany have confirmed this could happen</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s also the possibility that we\\'ve hit a rock. The mole was designed to go around smaller rocks &mdash; no bigger than a few inches [or centimeters] in size &mdash; but it may be pinned between the rock and the support structure. If that\\'s the case, moving the support structure may allow it to keep digging. If it\\'s hit a larger rock, there\\'s not much we can do.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why couldn\\'t the team anticipate the soil issue or hitting a rock?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We always knew there were environmental risks that could stop the mole. What we did is prepare as best we could so that they were calculated risks.</p>\\n\\n<p>The low-friction soil was unexpected: Everywhere else on Mars, soil has been different, which was what the mole was built for. We also knew there would be rocks underground, so we deliberately chose a landing site that was flat and had as few rocks as possible on the surface. Based on what we can see, the chances of hitting a rock this close to the surface that the mole can\\'t go around is only a few percent.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: What will happen once you lift the support structure?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> It depends on what we see. First, we\\'ll try a short hammering sequence with the mole. Then, regardless of whether there\\'s a cavity around the mole, we will likely press on the soil with a small scoop on the robotic arm to provide a load on the surface. Our calculations suggest that this should increase the friction and could help it dig.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: When would that occur?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We hope to lift the support structure by the end of June and to have our next steps decided by mid-July. After that, we will need time to run more tests.</p>\\n\\n<p><i>Engineer-scientist Troy Hudson of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the InSight mission.</i></p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why are you lifting the support structure in three steps? </b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> There are springs inside of the support structure that may still be in contact with the top of the mole. If that\\'s the case, we want to be careful lifting the structure so that we don\\'t accidentally pull the mole out. If that happened, we won\\'t be able to insert it back into its hole in the soil. So we\\'ll lift the support structure a little bit at a time, checking to make sure the mole isn\\'t coming with it.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why has it taken so much time to plan these next steps?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> We don\\'t want to take an action that makes the situation worse, so we\\'ve been moving very carefully. InSight is also a Discovery class mission, meaning it was meant to be more affordable &mdash; and to accept more risk &mdash; than a flagship NASA mission. So the team is very small; we don\\'t command the lander every day, and commands that are sent up need to be rigorously tested to make sure they\\'ll work the way we want them to. We want every action to be safe for HP<sup>3</sup>, the robotic arm <i>and</i> InSight\\'s seismometer, which is very close by.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Q: Why can\\'t you just pick up the mole and move it to another spot?</b></p>\\n\\n<p><b>A:</b> The robotic arm, which we inherited from another mission, wouldn\\'t be able to pick up the mole. We designed HP<sup>3</sup>\\'s support structure to be grasped by the arm\\'s grapple, but the mole was never designed to be handled that way.</p>\\n\\n<p>We think the issue is a lack of friction in the soil under InSight. So even if we <i>could</i> pick up the mole, it wouldn\\'t matter where we put it &mdash; we would still have the same friction problem. If the issue is a rock, there\\'s no way to guarantee you wouldn\\'t just hit another rock.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

Clay often forms in water, which is essential for life; Curiosity is exploring Mount Sharp to see if it had the conditions to support life billions of years ago. The rover\\'s mineralogy instrument, called CheMin (Chemistry and Mineralogy), provided the first analyses of rock samples drilled in the clay-bearing unit.

The stack includes the aeroshell as well as a rover stand-in (the real rover is undergoing final assembly in JPL\\'s High Bay 1 cleanroom) and other components. Together, they are assembled, or stacked, in the same configuration as when it launches toward Mars in July 2020.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We test the hardware components with a random noise spectrum in order to replicate a launch environment,\" said Andy Rose, manager of the Environmental Test Facilities at JPL. \"We reach sound levels as high as 150 decibels, which would really rattle your fillings if you were inside the chamber at the time.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, the technicians waited for each several-minute run to end before opening the chamber door to inspect the spacecraft in their cleanroom attire (the spacecraft must remain contamination-free to adhere to <a href=\"https://sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/planetary-protection\" target=\"_blank\">planetary protection rules</a>). By day\\'s end, the stack had been acoustically tested and inspected six times. Then the vehicle was double-bagged in clean antistatic nylon film and transported back to the Spacecraft Assembly Facility\\'s High Bay 1 cleanroom.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"For the acoustic test, the stack had the heat shield pointed up, but for the thermal vacuum test, it had to be down,\" said Gruel. \"The best place to turn it over is the cleanroom, where we have a fixture designed for that process.\" Once the stack passed muster, the team rebagged it and sent it out for thermal testing.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Into the Cold</b></p>\\n\\n<p><span><div class=\\'image_module right\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22491_PIA23263--D2019_0426_G2775web.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Mars 2020 Spacecraft Gets Cold \\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22491_PIA23263--D2019_0426_G2775web.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n</span><b>Mars 2020 Spacecraft Gets Cold:</b><span> Engineers prepare the Mars 2020 spacecraft for a thermal vacuum (TVAC) test in the Space Simulator Facility at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

The historic chamber has hosted spacecraft from NASA\\'s Mariner missions of the early 1960s to Voyager and Cassini to all of the Mars rovers. The 2020 stack was suspended from cables so the cold realities of interplanetary cruise could hit the spacecraft from every angle.</p>\\n\\n<p>With the 16-ton door closed, a near-vacuum environment was established. Then, as the Mars 2020 test team looked on, the baffled chamber walls were flooded with liquid nitrogen to chill it to -200 degrees Fahrenheit (-129 degrees Celsius). To simulate the Sun\\'s rays that Mars 2020 will encounter during its voyage, powerful xenon lamps several floors below the chamber illuminated, their light directed onto a mirror at the top of the chamber and reflected down on the spacecraft. Eight days later the lamps were turned off, atmosphere was reintroduced to the chamber, and the door opened. Acoustic and thermal vacuum testing was complete.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This is the most comprehensive stress test you can put a spacecraft through here on Earth,\" said Gruel. \"We flew in our simulated space environment for a week and a day, checking and rechecking the performance of every onboard system and subsystem. And everything looked great &mdash; which is a good thing, because next time this spacecraft stack hits a vacuum, it will be on its way to Mars for real.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>On May 10, the stack returned yet again to the High Bay 1 cleanroom. Just feet away, technicians worked on the 2,314-pound (1,050-kilogram) Mars 2020 rover that will be part of the stack at launch. The rover already had more than 90% of the components that will make up the interior of the chassis, from the science instruments and computers to subsystems and electrical boxes to the organized tangle of electrical wiring connecting them all.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 2020 rover carries an entirely new suite of instruments, including a sample-caching system that will collect samples of Mars for return to Earth on subsequent missions. The mission will launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July of 2020 and land at Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 Project at JPL manages rover development for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

The same way MRO is the primary relay for Curiosity, Odyssey (NASA\\'s longest-lived orbiter) is the primary relay for the agency\\'s latest Martian inhabitant, InSight. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter recently started <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8410/nasas-maven-spacecraft-shrinking-its-mars-orbit-to-prepare-for-mars-2020-rover/\">changing its orbit</a> in preparation to cover the Mars 2020 rover\\'s entry after it lands in February 2021. After data is sent up to an orbiter, it\\'s beamed to giant antennas at one of three locations around Earth, all of which are part of NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/news/\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Space Network</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>That relay network is now international. The European Space Agency\\'s Trace Gas Orbiter has been carrying an ever-increasing share of data sent from the surface. And all of these orbiters are preparing for the arrival of ESA\\'s Rosalind Franklin ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to land the same year as Mars 2020.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mars Landings</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Orbiters like MRO and Odyssey are snap-happy, constantly imaging potential landing sites for future missions. But after a site has been selected and a mission is sent to Mars, orbiters play another critical role.</p>\\n\\n<p>Before a surface mission can begin conducting science, it has to land safely. Successful landings require clocklike precision so that the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere at just the right angle, the parachute opens at the right time and sensors detect the rapidly approaching surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>MRO and other orbiters serve as black boxes, recording data about each landing, which grow more difficult with the sort of added mass that comes with a mission like Mars 2020. Engineers use the data to design safer missions &mdash; which will be key to sending astronauts to Mars. With plans to return astronauts to the surface of the Moon by 2024, NASA is looking ahead at humans exploring the Red Planet, too.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/7741_MRO-infographic-by-the-numbers-may2019-1280.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Facts about the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/7741_MRO-infographic-by-the-numbers-may2019-1280.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter By The Numbers:</b> Over the past decade, the mission has shown how dynamic Mars remains today, as well as how diverse its past environmental conditions have been.

But far more often, passing winds cleared off the rover\\'s solar panels and gave it an energy boost. Those dust clearings allowed Opportunity and its sister rover, Spirit, to survive for years beyond their 90-day expiration dates.</p>\\n\\n<p>Dust clearings are also expected for Mars\\' newest inhabitant, the InSight lander. Because of the spacecraft\\'s weather sensors, each clearing can provide crucial science data on these events, as well &mdash; and the mission already has a glimpse at that.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Feb. 1, the 65th Martian day, or sol, of the mission, InSight detected a passing wind vortex (also known as a dust devil if it picks up dust and becomes visible; InSight\\'s cameras didn\\'t catch the vortex in this case). At the same time, the lander\\'s two large solar panels experienced very small bumps in power &mdash; about 0.7% on one panel and 2.7% on the other &mdash; suggesting a tiny amount of dust was lifted.</p>\\n\\n<p>Those are whispers compared to cleanings observed by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, where dust-clearing wind gusts occasionally boosted power by as much as 10% and left solar panels visibly cleaner. But the recent event has given scientists their first measurements of wind and dust interacting \"live\" on the Martian surface; none of NASA\\'s solar-powered rovers have included meteorological sensors that record so much <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8415/insight-is-the-newest-mars-weather-service/?site=insight\">round-the-clock data</a>. In time, data from dust cleanings could inform the design of solar-powered missions as well as research on how wind sculpts the landscape.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It didn\\'t make a significant difference to our power output, but this first event is fascinating science,\" said InSight science team member Ralph Lorenz of Johns Hopkins University\\'s Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. \"It gives us a starting point for understanding how the wind is driving changes on the surface. We still don\\'t really know how much wind it takes to lift dust on Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Engineers regularly calculate a \"dust factor,\" a measure of how much dust is covering the panels, when analyzing InSight\\'s solar power. While they saw no change in dust factor around the time of this passing dust devil, they saw a clear increase in electrical current, suggesting it did lift a little bit of dust.</p>\\n\\n<p>Key to measuring these cleanings are InSight\\'s weather sensors, collectively known as the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite, or APSS. During this first dust event, APSS saw a steady increase in wind speed and a sharp drop in air pressure &mdash; the signature of a passing dust devil.</p>\\n\\n<p>The wind direction changed by about 180 degrees, which would be expected if a dust devil had passed directly over the lander. APSS measured a peak wind speed of 45 miles per hour (20 meters per second). But it also detected the biggest air pressure drop ever recorded by a Mars surface mission: 9 pascals, or 13% of ambient pressure. That pressure drop suggests there may have been even stronger winds that were too turbulent for sensors to record.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The absolute fastest wind we\\'ve directly measured so far from InSight was 63 miles per hour (28 meters per second), so the vortex that lifted dust off our solar panels was among the strongest winds we\\'ve seen,\" said InSight participating scientist Aymeric Spiga of the Dynamic Meteorology Laboratory at Sorbonne University in Paris. \"Without a passing vortex, the winds are more typically between about 4-20 miles per hour (2-10 meters per second), depending on time of day.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>This dust lifting happened at 1:33 p.m. local Mars time, which is also consistent with the detection of a dust devil. On both Mars and Earth, the highest levels of dust devil activity are usually seen between about noon and 3 p.m., when the intensity of sunlight is strongest and the ground is hot compared with the air above it.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight landed on Nov. 26, 2018, in Elysium Planitia, a windy region on the Martian equator. The lander has already detected many passing dust devils, and Lorenz said it\\'s likely the spacecraft will see a number of large dust cleanings over the course of its two-year prime mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>Each of InSight\\'s dinner-table-size solar panels has gathered a thin dust layer since landing. Their power output has fallen about 30% since then, due both to dust as well as Mars to moving farther from the Sun.

More importantly, it fosters conversation and builds shared goals, which will be essential as the agency drives forward to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>There may be no better example of that connection than NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASAInSight\" target=\"_blank\">Mars InSight mission</a>, which won a social media People\\'s Voice Award for Education & Discovery. After landing on Mars in November 2018, the mission generated more than one million social media posts from members of the public. The hashtag #MarsLanding even trended higher than #CyberMonday on the Monday after Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two other agency digital properties received the People\\'s Voice award in their categories: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">NASA.gov</a>, the agency\\'s primary website, won its 11th People\\'s Voice award in Government & Civil Innovation; and the <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Solar System Exploration</a> site won its third People\\'s Voice award in the Science category.</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Change</a> website was also nominated in the Green category, and the video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-kcKjmsCO8U\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Call of Science\"</a> was nominated in the 360-degree Video category.</p>\\n\\n<p>The agency\\'s reach on social media extends beyond its own programs. When the Event Horizon Telescope released the first image of a black hole on April 10, NASA\\'s follow up post on Instagram received 3.4 million likes and 33,500 comments. Social media also lets NASA join conversations about pop culture, leading to online interactions, such as those with singer Ariana Grande and Marvel Studios.</p>\\n\\n<p>The agency\\'s use of social media really took off in 2008, when Veronica McGregor, news manager at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, began tweeting in the voice of the Mars Phoenix Lander. Since then, the agency has added channels across a variety of platforms. On Twitter, NASA has 66 million followers, with 60 million on Facebook and 51 million on Instagram.</p>\\n\\n<p>This year\\'s Webbys are the second and third for NASA\\'s overall social media presence, having won both the Webby and People\\'s Voice award in 2017.</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s social media presence and the NASA.gov website are managed by NASA\\'s Office of Communications. The Mars InSight Lander social media account, Climate Change, and Solar System Exploration websites are managed by JPL, which also produced \"The Call of Science\" video.</p>\\n\\n<p>Established in 1996, The Webby Awards are presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.

The Martian surface is extremely quiet, allowing SEIS, InSight\\'s specially designed seismometer, to pick up faint rumbles. In contrast, Earth\\'s surface is quivering constantly from seismic noise created by oceans and weather. An event of this size in Southern California would be lost among dozens of tiny crackles that occur every day.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The Martian Sol 128 event is exciting because its size and longer duration fit the profile of moonquakes detected on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions,\" said Lori Glaze, Planetary Science Division director at NASA Headquarters.</p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s Apollo astronauts installed five seismometers that measured thousands of quakes while operating on the Moon between 1969 and 1977, revealing seismic activity on the Moon. Different materials can change the speed of seismic waves or reflect them, allowing scientists to use these waves to learn about the interior of the Moon and model its formation. NASA currently is planning to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, laying the foundation that will eventually enable human exploration of Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight\\'s seismometer, which the lander <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight\">placed on the planet\\'s surface</a> on Dec. 19, 2018, will enable scientists to gather similar data about Mars. By studying the deep interior of Mars, they hope to learn how other rocky worlds, including Earth and the Moon, formed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Three other seismic signals occurred on March 14 (Sol 105), April 10 (Sol 132) and April 11 (Sol 133). Detected by SEIS\\' more sensitive Very Broad Band sensors, these signals were even smaller than the Sol 128 event and more ambiguous in origin. The team will continue to study these events to try to determine their cause.</p>\\n\\n<p>Regardless of its cause, the Sol 128 signal is an exciting milestone for the team.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'ve been waiting months for a signal like this,\" said Philippe Lognonn&eacute;, SEIS team lead at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) in France. \"It\\'s so exciting to finally have proof that Mars is still seismically active. We\\'re looking forward to sharing detailed results once we\\'ve had a chance to analyze them.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Most people are familiar with quakes on Earth, which occur on faults created by the motion of tectonic plates. Mars and the Moon do not have tectonic plates, but they still experience quakes &ndash; in their cases, caused by a continual process of cooling and contraction that creates stress. This stress builds over time, until it is strong enough to break the crust, causing a quake.</p>\\n\\n<p>Detecting these tiny quakes required a huge feat of engineering. On Earth, high-quality seismometers often are sealed in underground vaults to isolate them from changes in temperature and weather. InSight\\'s instrument has several ingenious <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8407/insights-seismometer-now-has-a-cozy-shelter-on-mars/?site=insight\">insulating barriers</a>, including a cover built by JPL called the Wind and Thermal Shield, to protect it from the planet\\'s extreme temperature changes and high winds.</p>\\n\\n<p>SEIS has surpassed the team\\'s expectations in terms of its sensitivity. The instrument was provided for InSight by the French space agency, Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES), while these first seismic events were identified by InSight\\'s Marsquake Service team, led by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We are delighted about this first achievement and are eager to make many similar measurements with SEIS in the years to come,\" said Charles Yana, SEIS mission operations manager at CNES.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA\\'s Discovery Program, managed by the agency\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supports spacecraft operations for the mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>A number of European partners, including CNES and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), support the InSight mission.

       "   'date': 'April 18, 2019',\n",
       "   'body': '<p>For the past few months, the clean room floor in High Bay 1 at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has been covered in parts, components and test equipment for the Mars 2020 spacecraft, scheduled for launch toward the Red Planet in July of 2020. But over the past few weeks, some of these components &mdash; the spacecraft-rocket-laden landing system and even the stand-in for the rover (christened \"surrogate-rover\") &mdash; have seemingly disappeared.</p>\\n\\n<p>In reality, they are still there, tucked neatly into the entry capsule, as they will be when it\\'s time for launch. The procedure is known as vehicle stacking and involves a hyper-detailed plan for what goes where and when.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"One of our main jobs is to make sure the rover and all the hardware that is required to get the rover from here on Earth to the surface of Mars fits inside the payload fairing of an <span>Atlas V </span>rocket, which gives us about 15 feet [5 meters] of width to work with,\" said David Gruel, assembly, test and launch operations (ATLO) manager for Mars 2020 at JPL.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first step is to place the rocket-powered descent stage on top of the surrogate rover (the real rover is being integrated and tested in tandem with the spacecraft stack). Then, when all the holes line up and everything is attached, checked and re-checked again, the backshell is lowered over them via gantry crane.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"That crane has lifted almost every spacecraft that\\'s come through JPL since <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mariner-1/\" target=\"_blank\">Mariner</a>,\" said Gruel. \"To safely lift the large pieces of the Mars 2020 spacecraft, we utilize a dozen technicians and engineers.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After the backshell is in place and everything is determined to be fitting properly, the team puts on the parachute nose cone, which protects the parachute during atmospheric entry, followed by the massive doughnut-shaped cruise stage, which will power the Mars 2020 spacecraft on its seven-month voyage to the Red Planet. Then the vehicle stack is turned on its side so technicians and engineers have access to the mating points between the cruise and descent stages to make connections. The stack is then returned to its original position (cruise stage on top) so the heat shield can be raised into position and attached.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Stacking is an important milestone in mission development, because as good as our computer models are, we still need to put it together to show that the bolt holes line up and everything fits together,\" said Gruel. \"It is a great feeling for the entire project when we see the stack sitting there waiting to go for the next part of its journey, which will eventually lead to a launch pad at the Cape Canaveral in July of next year.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After three weeks, stacking is finished on April 3, and the spacecraft is transported to JPL\\'s Environmental Test Facility to undergo acoustic testing. During this testing the stack will be bombarded with a thundering wall of sound designed to imitate the sound waves generated during launch. Then, after a check to make sure no bolts have rattled loose or attachment points have become unstuck, the stack heads to the thermal vacuum chamber for a week-long test that simulates the harsh environment of space to assess how the Mars-bound craft and its instruments operate under flightlike conditions.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Nothing is static with this mission,\" said Gruel. \"After the acoustic and thermal vac tests, the stacked spacecraft is returned to the assembly building for de-stack, then more testing and more work. Until the hold-down bolts on the Atlas rocket blow and our rover is headed to Mars in July of 2020, there is almost always something being assembled, tested or modified.\"  </p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 rover will conduct geological assessments of its landing site on Mars, determine the habitability of the environment, search for signs of ancient Martian life, and assess natural resources and hazards for future human explorers. Scientists will use the instruments aboard the rover to identify and collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in sealed tubes and leave them on the planet\\'s surface for potential return to Earth on a future Mars mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Mars 2020 Project at JPL manages rover development for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

       "   'date': 'April 11, 2019',\n",
       "   'body': '<p>Scientists working with NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover have been excited to explore a region called \"the clay-bearing unit\" since <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1158/the-strange-attraction-of-gale-crater/\">before the spacecraft launched</a>. Now, the rover has finally tasted its first sample from this part of Mount Sharp. Curiosity drilled a piece of bedrock nicknamed \"Aberlady\" on Saturday, April 6 (the 2,370th Martian day, or sol, of the mission), and delivered the sample to its internal mineralogy lab on Wednesday, April 10 (Sol 2374).</p>\\n\\n<p>The rover\\'s drill chewed easily through the rock, unlike some of the tougher targets it faced nearby on Vera Rubin Ridge. It was so soft, in fact, that the drill didn\\'t need to use <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8314/curiosity-tests-a-new-way-to-drill-on-mars/\">its percussive technique</a>, which is helpful for snagging samples from harder rock. This was the mission\\'s first sample obtained using only rotation of the drill bit.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Curiosity has been on the road for nearly seven years,\" said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Finally drilling at the clay-bearing unit is a major milestone in our journey up Mount Sharp.\"</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22403_PIA23137-1280x.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Curiosity Sees \\'Waves\\' in the Clay Unit \" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22403_PIA23137-1280x.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Curiosity Sees \\'Waves\\' in the Clay Unit</b>: The hills and troughs in this little valley, carved between a ridge and cliffs higher up Mount Sharp, almost look like undulating waves.

NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spied a strong clay \"signal\" here long before Curiosity landed in 2012. Pinpointing the source of that signal could help the science team understand if a wetter Martian era shaped this layer of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain Curiosity has been climbing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity has discovered clay minerals in mudstones all along its journey. These mudstones formed as river sediment settled within ancient lakes nearly 3.5 billion years ago. As with water elsewhere on Mars, the lakes eventually dried up.</p>\\n\\n<p>The clay beacon seen from space brought the rover here, but the region clearly has several other stories to tell. Now that Curiosity is searching this area, scientists can peer around as geological tourists, finding a landscape both ancient and new. There are several kinds of bedrock and sand, including active sand ripples that have shifted in the past year. Pebbles are scattered everywhere &mdash; are they eroding from the local bedrock? Several eye-catching landmarks, such as \"Knockfarril Hill,\" stick out as well.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22405_PIA23139-1280x.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\"Curiosity Surveys the \\'Clay-Bearing Unit\\'\" src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22405_PIA23139-1280x.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>Curiosity Surveys the \\'Clay-Bearing Unit\\'</b>: The Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover captured this mosaic as it explored the clay-bearing unit on February 3, 2019 (Sol 2309).

We\\'re excited to see what this first sample tells us about the ancient environment, especially about water.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The Aberlady sample will give the team a starting point for thinking about the clay-bearing unit. They plan to drill several more times over the course of the next year.
